    & The city of Montore is known for its hegata population (half-demons), people descended from Eidola, a class of supernatural creatures whose existence predates that of humans. Eidola have a deep respect for nature, but this link has been severed. The current governement's agenda, many believe, only serves to widen the growing divide between the two groups. There is a growing anti-eidola sentiment in the city, this has given rise to underground hegata factions, such as the {*Ars Goetia*} and the {*Solomon's Devils*}.
    & Tension in Montore is high, Sy thrives in climates like this, but things change when the fight hits a little too close to home.

    > <li> <b>Characters:</b>  {*{{Luna Leap|#luna}}*}, {*{{Space Panda|#panda}}*}, {*{{Straw Surfer|#straw}}*} and {*{{Kidd Kosmo|#kidd}}*}.
    > <li> <b>Summary:</b> A story about a league of misfits called "Medussa's four", who race through the Austral system using non-regulated means of propulsion. 
    > </ul>
    > </columns>
    & {*Encela*}, grandparent of {*Luna Leap*}, is banned from the "Belt Championship" by the IFS (interplanetary federation of ships) for breaking rules relating to race technique and style. The IFS has been poisoned by greed, their monopoly of transport and racing that spans many systems, Encela feels, is downright disgusting. 
    & In reaction to this, Luna - who has prodigious skill with the taming, and riding of wild {*cyclomedussas*} - forms her own league dedicated not to form and rules, but to the simple test of superior speed. The group also advocates for the 'right to build and use one's own transport', a thing the IFS has made illegal. This league of misfits, referred to as {*'Medussa's four'*} includes {*{{Luna Leap|#luna}}*}, {*{{Space Panda|#panda}}*}, {*{{Straw Surfer|#straw}}*} and {*{{Kidd Kosmo|#kidd}}*}.
    & In these races, the participants race through the Austral system - which consists of a multitude of tiny planets and moons - and use the relative movement and gravity of the planets or other astronomical object to increase their speed.
    & Their movement aims to dismantle the unfair regulations that has been strangling the habitants of the {*Australs*} for many cycles now. 
    & HISTORY
    & The Lepori, Denurith and Ursada all stem from the Homini, from ships that left their homeplanet Retna to explore the grandioseness that is their universe (The Australs). They lived aboard their ships for thousands of years, keeping some contact, while evolving as separate species. Many years later, they resolved to live near one another again, with the stars growing dark togetherness and harmony has never been so important. They steered their ships back over to Retna, the only planet capable of sustaining life, now a center of exchange of goods and knowledge and the place where all 4 races can go to live as equals.
    & 2 now orbit the planet in their ships, all, but the Ursada's ship "The Arkto" that was decommissioned due to various technical problems. Now, the Ursada live on Retna's soil. 
    & {*Medussa*} was the name of the station orbitting Retna, the base model for the 3 generational travel ships that departed long ago, the 3 being {*The Santoshi Mata*}, {*Arkto*} and {*the Leveret*}.

ChaCha's underside has tentacles that twist and turn with incredible speed, pushing the air to propel itself forward. 
    & As a young Lepori, Lun-di developed an interest for racing because of {*Encela*}, grandparent and racer extraordinaire. She developed a great dislike for the {*IFS*} (interplanetary federation of ships), because of their affluence and rigidity.

    & Padna is a maverick, and doesn't need others to be happy, she likes parkour, to create her own paths in the world, and this is what led her to race through the Australs. Her family never had the money to board a ship to travel offplanet, and so Padna decided to create her own path.
    & Her time in hackspaces on Retna, earned her the skills to build her solar disc. The disc retracts into a baton for easy carrying, and fans out into a translucent circle, with solar cells embedded in the material. One end of the baton is equipped with a thruster, enabling her to get some momentum, so she can reach the gravity of a near astronomical object to propel herself onward.

Her family is well-off, permitting her to have a ship of her own. She has taken part in the Belt Championships many times, but aches for the freedom and creativity to design her own transport. Her sibling Lef is an Enforcer in the IFS, they have little contact, in fact, she cares little to know what he's up to given the dark nature of his work.
    & She heard of Encela's ban from racing, curious, Klo makes a trip to The Leveret to learn more about {*cyclomedussas*}. Klo is privileged, in the sense that she can go wherever she likes, and uses this to help others who are less fortunate than herself. She is a jovial being, high-energy and always looking for something to do. Klo used to be oblivious to a lot of the bad happenings on Retna, now she does all she can to right this and inform herself.   
    & Unable to tame a cyclomedussa, lacking the patience mostly, Klo tries and find her own DIY transport. Back on Retna, she finds a like-minded invidiual who helps her to build the tech for a cylinder that elongates in perpetuity, or "infinite straw" that she now uses to travel through space.

Lef is sibbling to {{Klo|#straw}}, both lead very difference lives and are unaware of what the other is doing, due to Lef leaving home to join the federation at a young age.

    & Because her brother worked for a Pokémon researcher, Casey learned a lot about Pokémon from him. Her brother raised particularly large Pokémon, and she quickly grew fond of the large and intimidating breeds. She would rather choose a gigantic and grumpy Nidoking over a cute and friendly Pikachu.
    & For some reason, her brother started to stay away from home for days on end; it was then that Casey decided to go off on her own journey. She got her first Pokémon from her father. It was a young Totodile. Along her journey Casey saw and fought many Pokémon, catching the ones she favored. Now her party is large and consists mostly of heavy and intimidating Pokémon. Because of her researcher background and knowledge of Pokémon, Casey has chosen to follow the breeder’s life. She excels in breeding ‘monster’ egg type Pokémon, but is not limited to that.

    & To an untrained eye Ferris would look rather ‘average’ mainly because he doesn't stand out, but there is one thing that makes him different from most teenagers; he is blind.
    & Ferris was born in Saffron city but was raised in Fuchsia city, the city known for the first Safari Zone. Because the city was always full of Pokémon, Ferris learned about these creatures at a very young age. Since Pokémon were always around him he never thought of them as interesting monsters, he thought they were normal. Pokémon generally bored Ferris until he reached the age of 10, where he found out that you could explore the world just by saying you were a trainer. Infatuated with the idea of hitchhiking wherever he wanted, Ferris finally decided to get his own Pokémon. He wandered deep into the safari zone and saw several different types of Pokémon, but wasn’t happy with any of them. It wasn’t until he illegally snuck into the zone after dark when he found the Pokémon he wanted, Scyther. After a long struggle Ferris finally caught the bug Pokémon and started his adventure.
    & In the beginning of his adventure Ferris thought that it would only be him and Scyther the whole time, but it didn’t take long for him to yearn for more Pokémon. As he filled his pokédex the condition of his Pokémon worsened. He started treating them more like tools than actually living creatures, and his sour attitude towards his Pokémon changed many of them. His Golduck Mosa, which he had gotten from his father, had changed from a loyal loving Pokémon to a stubborn grump who had a hard time trusting strangers. As he traveled around, Ferris was known for his harsh training and stern attitude and it wasn’t long until people started avoiding him.
    & Alone, he continued on to Hoenn.

Musi doesn't like it, but doesn't do much against it either, it's just how it is. He considers himself lucky to be where he is.

Even when assigned sleeping quarters indoors, he goes back to sleep on his boat. Musi enjoys playing guitar on deck, and to sing, whether he's alone or in the company of others.

    @ Do not despise anyone, refrain from any uncharitable judgements of others which you may feel in your heart and from any unkind suspicions regarding your neighbour, and always put the best interpretation on other people's words and actions | Unknown source
    @ Try always to eliminate in yourself any wish to dominate others, do not seek glory or praise – this can lead to the ruin of your soul. Do not allow yourself to think that you possess particular virtues that are lacking in others. | Unknown source
    @ You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. | Marcus Aurelius  
    @ In the unification of two minds, orientation of sexuality is irrelevant. | Abhijit Naskar
    @ We should indeed keep calm in the face of difference, and live our lives in a state of inclusion and wonder at the diversity of humanity. | George Takei
    @ We really must understand that the lust for affluence in contemporary society is psychotic. It is psychotic because it has completely lost touch with reality. We crave things we neither need nor enjoy. | Richard Foster
    @ Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Things do not change, we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. | Henry David Thoreau
