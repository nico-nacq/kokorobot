WIKTOPHER
  BREF : Wiktopher begins with a fall, living on the back of a giant desert creature can be dangerous like that. Lupin has never left home, and wouldnt have if it hadnt been for that accident. Being alone in a new place is scary, but not if you have Eka with you to light the way. Together, they learn the innumerable ways of the world. They traverse deserts and villages, meeting their inhabitants and discovering their customs.

    > <li>{*Alignment*}: Neutral good</li>
    > <li>{*Orientation*}: Pansexual</li>
    > <li>{*Gender*}: Cis male</li>
    > <li>{*Family*}: Luciano Malvado, Petra Mintenko and {{Token Malvado|#token}}.</li>
    > <li>{*Appearance*}: Light, sandy blonde hair, cut short. Bright-eyed, fair-skinned, often wears bright mismatched clothes. Thin, dark-eyed, not very strong of body. Has fish tattoos on the neck, black bars on the left arm, and a tattoo of two winged persons arm-in-arm. Has multiple piercings.</li>
    > </ul>
    > </columns>
    > <hr/>
    & When the family split up, young Orion went with Petra to Kiev and continued school there while living with Petra's mother in the family home. Orion is a happy go-lucky kid, and can make the best of any situation. Orion went to a lot of clubs, concerts and parties, and began taking club drugs, such as LSD and ecstasy. Orion did get into trouble for it, and eventually started to take synthetic opioids and sedatives instead. With the recent crackdowns in Kiev, these were easier, and cheaper, to procure than naturally-derived drugs. After hearing of his brother {{Token}}'s accident, and old enough to make the decision, Orion decided to move back to Canada. He thought that this move, as well as Token's presence, would help him consume less, but this change did little to appease Orion's addictive nature.
    & Orion now works in a bar in {*the Village*} in evenings, a perfect arena for his promiscuous ways. He is seldom seen alone. Orion cares about all he meets, even strangers, and goes out of his way to care for them if they're in trouble. While he considers himself a forever-child, he will become the adult in the room if a situation warrants it, especially when trouble-prone people like {{Sy}} are around. 
    & Orion is confident and wears whatever, caring little of the opinions of others. Not many show aggression towards Orion because of his genial nature, but if threatened with violence and words are not enough to prevent an attack, he will run, if running is not possible then he will deflect most attacks - thanks to multiple training sessions with Token. That is all he will ever do, Orion will never harm another.
    & Galeru has always been part of Orion's life, a fearful creature, she worries constantly for her friend. She lacks courage, and shows aggression when cornered. Galeru takes the form of an orange dog-fish, covered in scales, with large fins and dark globulous eyes. She swims through the air, defying all gravity and logic.
    * Comics

He bears a deep cut at his lip, and is missing two fingers on his left hand, with a third cut at the joint. His right hand is missing half its index finger.</li>
    > </ul>
    > </columns>
    > <hr/>
    & Token's parents split up when he was young, he stayed with Luciano in Lasalle while Petra brought {{Orion}} back to Kiev. Petra never did love him, she always had a preference for Orion because he was better-looking, and smarter than he. Token pretended to be okay with this, but it did hurt, a lot. Luciano too showed favoritism, and could see a good fighter in Token. Early on, Luciano trained him, and later had him fight in city tournaments, all around the province and the country. 
    & Token never professed a deep love for boxing, but it was a way to exteriorize his anger and disappointments in life. It became an addiction. Token wanted to win, and loved the feeling that came with it. The incident that crippled his hands was a terrible blow to his career, and his psyche. His father, was mixed in some dark affairs, he owed money to many important people. A group came into the house one night to hurt his father, Token, good with his fists, fought them back with much ferocity, but was stabbed, maimed and defiled – in more ways than one. Because of these events, he suffers from PTSD. He is medicated, and has sought help, but it has caused him to go off the rails at times. 
    & He recovered from the physical damage, and his fighting, despite lacking some fingers, was just as good. In fact, it earned him quite a reputation in the fighting world, the whole ordeal propelled him to fame. He continues to fight professionally, and has become a role model for disabled fighters everywhere.
    & Token never forgave his father, and as of now, their relationship only gets more sour with time. This, worsened by the fact that his father has not ceased his grubby deals which continuously puts him at risk. Family aside, Token is liked by most, he his always smiling and pleasant to all he meets. Being well-liked is very important to him, and to his professional career. He trains everyday, he spends much energy on his physical shape while neglecting his mind's health. 
    & {{Sy}}, a childhood friend, brings out the worse in him, or the real him Sy would argue. Token makes friends easy, but never gets too close, in fear that they too, would find what was really hidden underneath the mask. The only other person who did get close, was {{Mari}}. They met during a fundraising event for a new sports center in town, and hit it off right away. Nowadays, they live together downtown, and frequently appear in magazines together given their reputation and good looks. 
    & {*Specter*} is Token's companion, and came to be when Orion left with Petra. Specter has a ghostly figure, a large round head attached to a smaller translucent body. Two dark pools of black for eyes, they reflect much of what he's feeling. Specter is confident most times, but is not afraid to show weakness when necessary. He is an open-book, and will tell all if asked.

    & Kim's mother owned a small restaurant, {*the Sotto Voce*}, while her father worked as a CSI. Growing up, occasionally there would be trouble from her father's court cases, but other than that their lives then were simple and happy - that is, until {{Seir}} came into the picture. The creature's presence in her life shifted all of that around, and soon, Kim's crowd mostly consisted of these strange beings. 
    & Nowadays, Kim runs Sotto Voce almost on her own, due to her mother's advanced age. After many years of living with Seir, her mind was able to see past this veil of confusion, and she distanced herself from that life. A lot of it remains a blur in her brain, and that creature still lingers, but there's little to be done about this. Kim is no longer innocent, and has a stronger mind now, and can fend off most of his advances. 
    & Kim is relatively easy-going, mostly relaxed, and tries to not burden herself with worry and fear. She is hot-headed at times, and will act without thinking, especially if someone tells her not to do something. In dangerous situations, she can fend for herself all while protecting the ones she cares about. {{Orion}} is practically a brother to her and they are very close, they often go out together, to unwind.
    & Her on and off relationship with {{Sy}} is a difficult one, while realizing he's bad for her, and her for him, it's like they can't help but be mixed into dark affairs together. 
    & Gelert, a loyal two-headed canine beast is always at her heels. Gelert is generally kind, and likes to joke around,  but often contradicts himself - the two heads are to be blamed for this.

Growing up, she herself, decided to take on more hands-on sports, like kickboxing and wrestling. This comes naturally to Mari, she enjoys a good fight, and it's why she gets along with {{Token}} so well. She spends much of her time training. Being so athletic, authors of sports magazines approach her as well as {{Pen|#token}}, asking her about doing some photo shoots. Many times Token and Mari would end up in full page spreads together. 
    & Mari is confident, in body and in mind. While aware of Token's problems, she deals with his panic attacks well enough, and can always calm him right down. 
    & Kusari, a ragged bird, keeps with Mari at all times and often does clash with {{Specter|#token}}. The bird is always chatting away, speaking in riddles, being purposely deceitful and putting ideas into people's heads.

    & Sy's father died young of brain cancer, and his mother still lives on the Kahnawake reserve in Tuscarora, but they never speak. Harlow spent little time with Sy as a kid, thought he was wicked - given his abilities. She didn't care where he was most times. He left home early on, and never looked back.
    & In his youth, Sy lived on his own terms, and liked to pick fights with the local kids. He was brought to {{Nemerald}}'s refuge, after phasing a child halfway through a telephone pole, resulting in their death. One day, he tried to pick a fight with {{Token}}, a boy that lived across the river. But he learned that day, that this boy was a pretty good fighter, what with his father being a local boxing celebrity and not just this: both shared similar abilties. They became friends then, although their relationship was not the healthiest. Most instances of conversation ended in a fist-fight, which evidently, Sy always lost.
    & Older Sy has an explosive temper, it doesn't take much to set him off. He is callous, not easy to befriend. Many try, taking pity on him, because despite his less-than-ideal personality. It is very difficult for him to care about others, and if he does, it's often because he finds joy in belittling them – or so he says. Sy's lack of foresight never fails to get him into trouble, and because he fears little, he will boldly stand in the face of a menacing character. This last trait, does mean he will try and protect others, but mostly because of his impulsivity. 
    & Sy possesses a "phasing" ability that allows him, as well as objects or people he has contact with, to become intangible. This power also disrupts any electrical field he passes through, causing machines to malfunction or be destroyed as he phases through them, and can induce shock and unconsciousness in living beings.

    & Seir is not of this reality, but bears a close resemblance to human males – although shares little with them. This being is a creature of greed, and can lull anyone into a false sense of security and happiness.
    & {{Nemerald}} consider Seir too reckless, too attached to humans, but Seir loves to defy him and to change the rules. Seir thrives on it, always looking for new ways to piss him off. Seir lives in luxury amongst mortals, with mutliple opulent houses scattered about the city and the world. These riches, are used to lure unsuspecting victims. Mischievous, this creature loves to play tricks on humans, and loves to spoil and twist their minds and thoughts.
    & Seir can see more colours than humans can, and can also see further, with more detail. As for hearing, all sounds are sharper, Seir can hear (and see) through vibrations in the environment. This skill, almost means that humans can have no secrets, this too, can be felt through their skin and the subtle expressions in their eyes and faces. Seir has a strong body, and moves fast - human eyes can't keep up. Many of this being's words are lies, it is difficult to befriend such a creature, but it is not impossible. Seir enjoys tricking people, but will get discouraged if there is no reaction, which is often the case for someone as stoic as Nemerald. Beings like Seir, need a strong reaction to validate their actions, otherwise there is no fun in it and therefore, no point to it. 
    & There is some sadness in Seir, a desire to be close to others, but this can only be achieved with trickery which only serves to deepen this being's growing anguish. Lack of validation, will only increase the damaging acts of this creature, Seir will go to great lengths to avoid feeling this way.

Making an enemy of Nemerald is a dangerous thing. While he is kind, he does not like to be deceived.
    & Not much is known of his past, but those close to him will say that he has been alive for many, many years. He has an old mind, made young by the look of his face and body. Nemerald possesses great knowledge, he can cure almost all that ails his patients, all, except aging, which he has been working on curing for some time – with little success.

His father Archie still travels on the ocean, while Musi stayed behind doing odd jobs for Matrix. Musi didn't intend on working for them, but he needed cash and the organization needed a skilled sailor to get their people on the offshore island of Goshin. He doesn't get involved in much of the happenings of Matrix, but does need to bring captives to the island, to his great displeasure. Musi doesn't like it, but doesn't do much against it either, it's just how it is. He considers himself lucky to be where he is.
    & Of course, this all changes when he is permanently assigned to Goshin, and hired on as a full-time member given his skill with water types. Even when assigned sleeping quarters indoors, he goes back to sleep on his boat. Musi enjoys playing guitar on deck, and to sing, whether he's alone or in the company of others.

ANIMALS
  LONG
    & Notes on animals I've seen during our travel. Behaviours, facts and observations.
    * Frigatebirds
    - The first time I spotted a frigate bird, was in San Jose Del Cabo in Baja California. I noticed two dark silhouettes aloft, long wings, a forked tail, they looked like bats. More curious, is how they rarely flap their wings, they soar on windcurrents. I later read, that these birds, like us, cross oceans, using the tradewinds as we do. How similar we are, i thought, except that we, need a vessel to match their skill. A lot of people we've met, are not so impressed with these birds, and call them 'bullies' because they steal from other birds. They harass seabirds, and follow them to the nest for a chance at their catch. They are said to be kleptoparisitic, but in fact they only do this to supplement their diet, they don't depend on it. 
    * Pied shag (Kāruhiruhi)
    - A type of cormorant, first seen in the Whangarei TownBasin. They liked to stand on our lines, to present their wings to the sun and air to dry them. Nature saw to make them good swimmers, but did not make their wings quick-dry. They dive into the water without disrupting the surface, their necks curving downward, and the rest of the body following, as if made of liquid. There was two living in our marina, an adult and a youngling, they sat on shore at low tide at times with other ducks, but never together. They never make a sound, except when they flap their wings on the water before taking to the skies. I wondered how they managed to find prey in the muddy water of the townbasin, as it turns out, according to this {{study|https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00114-017-1467-3}}, they have good underwater hearing and it is thought that this is how they locate their prey. 
    * Pukeko
    - Pukeko is a common bird in New Zealand, seen often in fields of tall grass, their blue-feathered bodies and orange beaks made them easy to spot at a distance. The first one I saw was near the bascule bridge in Whangarei, I walked 'the loop' often and saw a Pukeko every time. They probably had a nest nearby. These birds live in permanent social groups, the eggs are laid in a single nest and raised by all. I've seen them elsewhere, in Roturua, eating leaves and roots near the mud pools. They are funny birds, if you near them they will run or hide instead of flying away, and if they do fly, they will take off and land in a way that makes it seem like they've never flown before. This is odd, considering these birds can fly great distances to offshore islands. While on land, it appears that they prefer to walk, whenever possible. Birds that don't need to fly, will indulge in more food and get fatter, making flying awkward, and over long periods of time they lose use of their wings altogether. This is what happened to the Kakapo, and many other flightless birds. 
    * Whitemargin Unicornfish 
    - This type of Unicornfish has uniquely human features, with a comically elongated rostral protuberance that makes it look like a storybook goblin. Their lips are pursed, as if sucking on lemon in perpetuity. I first spotted this fish when we arrived in the Rangiroa atoll, swimming with other long-nosed friends beneath our boat and waiting for bits of food. Unicornfish is an illustrator's dream.

QUOTES

    & A collection of quotes, words to remember. I will gather all of the words from authors, artists or other, which I live by. 
    @ Do not despise anyone, refrain from any uncharitable judgements of others which you may feel in your heart and from any unkind suspicions regarding your neighbour, and always put the best interpretation on other people's words and actions | Unknown source
    @ Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today. Never force someone else to do anything which you can do yourself. Stop being tormented by the thoughts of things which might happen, but which in fact have not happened. If you feel angry about something, count to ten before doing or saying anything. If you still feel angry, count up to a hundred, and then, if necessary, up to a thousand. | Thomas Jefferson
    @ Try always to eliminate in yourself any wish to dominate others, do not seek glory or praise – this can lead to the ruin of your soul. Do not allow yourself to think that you possess particular virtues that are lacking in others. | Unknown source
    @ You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. | Marcus Aurelius | Meditations
