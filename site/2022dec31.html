<p>I never liked staying up late to celebrate the New Year. So this year we started to do something different. We got up in the dark, early, and walked near the water to get a good view of the east. Our goal was to catch the very first sunrise of 2022, a practice in Japan called "Hatsuhinode", or "the first sunrise".</p>

<p>It was beautiful out, tranquil, and white because of the recent snowfall. We walked down a hill to get near the water, the snow had been smoothed out by a hundred sleds the previous day. All long the hill, and at the bottom, we saw pieces of broken plastic sleds, deflated donuts, trash cans full of cheap, dead, single-use snow-day accessories, fun until they break, and they always will. I saw lonely mittens and jackets too. On the walk down I spotted a water bottle in the snow. I screamed when I saw it, it was the same model as the one I lost at sea in 2020. The bottle had been tucked into the dodger pocket, the dodger that was ripped off the deck after the wave event of June 2020. I loved that bottle, and there in my hands was its twin. I was selfish that day, I decided to take it home rather than to leave it for its owner to find.</p>

<p>In early January, I had some pandemic fatigue. Sick of the anger, sick of the stress, and the growing distance between people. In mid-December we went out at a bar with our friends Lloyd and Peter from the marina, Lloyd's friend Pamela was with us. We had some drinks at an Irish Pub, we drank too much and played games, and while in it I realized how I craved this sort of activity, desperately. This is the sort of thing I wanted to experience after returning from our circumnavigation of the Pacific. We made plans then to continue to play games together, but then came Omicron, and with it more restrictions. The bars closed, and we had to put a pause on game nights. We were back to our micro-communities again, which in our case meant Pino's interior. I'm glad we got to have an evening like that at all, but I also hope we can get to do more with others soon.</p>

<p>I signed up for a basic first aid course, something I ought to have done prior to us leaving to go offshore in 2016.</p>

<p>In February I pushed Wiktoper, formatting the story for print.</p>

<p>I have difficult being around a lot of people, I always have. Every encounter makes me want to fold back into myself. I feel like I rarely have the chance to say what I want to say in a conversation, everything is happening too quickly and I am always lagging behind. I am there, but also not there. I have difficulty saying the right thing when prompted, and when I cannot find an answer quickly enough I dig out a stock answer. In that way, I become flavorless, and I feel it and it sucks. The more I feel it, the less confidence I have in that moment. I am my own problem, but I also blame the lack of quiet, I cannot focus or recall anything in noisy space, and I blame the lack of time to arrange my thoughts before speaking. When home after an interaction, I re-live every moment, and am able to say the right thing. Sometimes I resign myself to being a quiet observer, because that is all I can manage.</p>
