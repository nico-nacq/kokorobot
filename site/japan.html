<p>We arrived there on a working holiday visa, with plans to try and live there for a while. We quickly found jobs, myself at Toneplus Animation Studios and Devine at Language Cloud, a start-up.</p>

<p>Devine's workmates helped us secure an appartment in Odaiba, where Language Cloud was located. That turned out to be a bitter sweet deal, because the proximity to the company meant that they expected Devine to be at work more often. But also, we wouldn't have gotten a great apartment like this without their help.</p>

<p>The appartment was too big for us. We bought used furniture from Sayonara sales on craigslist, but overall it was mostly empty. It was located right near the beach near Odaiba-kaihin koen station, in the Sea-rea buildings. We started to grow plants from avocado pits, potatoes and pumpkin seeds with much success.</p>

<p>Our spot in Odaiba was near many malls, like Palette Town, Venus Fort, Diver City etc. It was a busy, noisy area, but at night when everyone left before the last train, the place was ours. We loved talking walks along the water front, and through empty malls. The unicorn gundam was set up near Diver City, we visited it often.</p>

<p>We liked walking around Daiba Park, we had an amazing view of the Rainbow Bridge.</p>

<p>The beach was right at our doorstep.</p>

<p>My job was fine, but at times... difficult. My computer had many issues, and I lost a lot of time to its daily tamtrums. It got so bad that I started to make comics to make myself feel better.</p>

<p>We worked during the week, and explored Tokyo by biycle on weekends. Cycling became a big part of our lives. We cycled 30 km from work to home everyday.</p>

<p>Eventually, Devine quit the job. It was too much. We could barely see each other. In evenings we went to Saizeriya, a 24 h family restaurant, to rant about our jobs—it was that bad. Devine quit, used that time to work on Hiversaires at home, and eventually found another job at IKnow. This job was a better fit.</p>

<p>We started working on <a href='oquonie.html'>oquonie</a> together after Hiversaires, as a sideline to our full-time jobs.</p>

<p>We went out a lot, to cafes, restaurants etc. We attended concerts in small venues, visited friends as well as sights, like Mount Fuji, Yokohama etc.</p>
