<p>Kaddali is the leader of the Solomon's Devils(Solo Devs) and the original founder of the Ars Goetia. Their brain never seems to go off— not even in sleep. Kaddali, also known as "Kidd", hates being indoors, preferring a contact with the sky and the earth, always. In fact, Kidd is very attuned with nature, constantly observing patterns in the living world. They refuse to go anywhere indoors.</p>
<p>Kidd used to be a very genial being, back when Azi was still around. But now events in the world, and the loss of Azi has embittered them.</p>
<h3>Past</h3>
<p>Kidd and Azi met at a protest against the construction of a pipeline in Tuskatora. They quickly became inseparable, and eventually Kaddali fell for him. Kaddali loved Azi more than they'd ever loved anyone. They saw eye to eye on nearly everything, including the same vision for the future. Together, they created the Ars Goetia, and began to recruit members. The group's aim was to keep humans out the North (where the Taiga is, and where the ancients sleep).</p>
<p>When Kaddali thought Azi had died after a fight with the K-Firsts, the Ars Goetia's tactics grew very violent. Seir was part of the group then, they rarely agreed on anything but Kaddali thought he was an asset, given his finances. He helped fund many of their operations. But when Azi died, Kaddali's patience for Seir grew too thin, and after a heated argument the group was split in two. Seir led the Ars Goetia, and Kaddali created the Solomon's Devils, taking Daedante, Anuk, and Yinifer with them. Kaddali's biggest loss was Adelie, the only active ancient in Montore, who decided to stay with Seir.</p>
<p>5 years later, Ikkard joined the Solo D's, and brought in Yegon, a friend from Liskar that he thought would be a good fit. That day Kaddali learned that Azi had not died. He was happy that he had not died, but this happiness quickly turned to bitterness. He was different, and no longer shared his drive to retake what is theirs. Kaddali could see very little of Azi in him now, and while he did care for Yegon he could not stop wanting Azi to be here instead of him. Kaddali was heartbroken, they knew that things would never be the same between them. Yegon left the Solo D's during a mission.</p>
<p>Kaddali became unhinged, determined to throw more violence at the humans who had done this to them both. His hatred for Seir was still fresh then, even more so when they learned that Yegon had joined up with the Ars...</p></main><footer><p><a href='about.html'>Rekka Bellum</a> © 2009-2022 <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/#random'>Webring</a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek'>Mastodon</a> <a href='politics.html'>Politics</a></p></footer></body></html>
