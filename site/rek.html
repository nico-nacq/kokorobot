<p>Rekka (or Rek for short) is a cartoonist currently based in the waters of the Pacific Northwest, where the weather is mild and kinder to sailboats, but their heart is in Québec. They enjoy drawing by hand with ink, and are fond of long ocean passages, food preservation, cycling and birds (do ask them about cormorants).</p>
<p>With the project <a href='100r.html'>HundredRabbits</a>, Rek writes about permacomputing and food preservation.</p>
<p>They make art for magazines, children's books, as well as visuals for software and games. Their first self-published game <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> (designed with <a href='https://xxiivv.com' target="_blank">Devine</a>) was nominated for a visual arts award at the <a href='https://igf.com/2015' target="_blank">2015 Independent Games Festival</a> in San Francisco. They recently published <a href='busy_doing_nothing.html'>Busy Doing Nothing</a>, a book documenting their 50-day sail from Shimoda to Victoria.</p>
<p>Rek lived in Japan for two years, and after returning to Canada decided to try and return there by sailboat. And so, from 2016 to 2020, Rek has circumnavigated the Pacific Ocean by sail, passing through Mexico, French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands and Japan.</p>
<p>They've been making websites since they were a teenager, they would farm free geocities space by hot-linking between mutiple accounts. They've since abandoned that practice. These days, they enjoy making and maintaining simple websites. They manage <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank"></a>, <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank">GrimGrains</a>, <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank">100r.co</a>, <a href="https://wiktopher.ca" target="_blank">Wiktopher</a> and <a href="https://circacomic.kokorobot.ca" target="_blank">Circa Comic</a>.</p>

<h3>Small online community involvement</h3>
<p>In the early 2000's Rek was known as "Esse" online. Esse was active in the FDD(fictional digidestined) community, with the websites The Forgotten Digidestined (2001-2006), Esse's Digimon Adoption Agency (2002-2005) and Sagari-Cross (2005-2009). I hosted a forum where friends & I would roleplay our characters.</p>
<p>Esse hung around on DeviantArt, SheezyArt, but mostly on Isopharmacy, a small community forum they had created with friends. At the time, Esse and Devine created the studio <a href="drownspire.html">Drownspire</a>. We designed and sold small figurines (vambits), apparel, jewlery and books. At the time, they organized <b>Drink & Draw</b> events in Montreal. These events inspired the creation of art books (Erri) and comic collectives (<b>Merure</b>). We released 3 Merure books in total, under the non-profit name of MachineMachine.</p>
<p>Esse picked the name Rekka in 2012, inspired from the name Rakka in the anime Haibane Renmei.</p>
<p>Now Rekka hangs around the Merveilles instances on Mastodon, and likes it very much.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>In high school, Rek enjoyed working with wood and did many <a href="physical.html">art projects</a>.</p>
<p>Rek did a two-year creative arts program at the Champlain Regional College on the south shore of Montreal (2002-2004), where they learned how to do digital art, movie-making, as well as sculpture and painting (a very varied program). They helped found the Visual Arts Club in the school.</p>
<p>Then Rek attended the Cégep du Vieux Montréal and enrolled in their excellent 2d animation course (2005-2008), where they produced the short film <a href="uno.html">uno</a>.
<p>From 2007 to 2016, Rek worked in-house at a variety of studios like Mandarine 24, Volta, Pascal Blais Studio, Sava Transmédia, Toneplus Animation Studios (Japan), Hibernum Créations and Télé-Québec. They also did a lot of freelance work, illustrating children's books for ERPI, Boréal, Druide, Bayard Canada etc. After 2016, Rek focused on making projects for <a href="100r.html">hundredrabbits</a>.<p>
