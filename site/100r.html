But for the last several years, our success in our careers have forced us to work more than we'd like — both of us are ambitious in that way. After all, if you want somebody, you've got to work at it. My current situation though means I'll have to work even harder to a chance at it, i don't like to think about that, it makes me angry. Mari is working tonight and so I'm on my own. But the worst thing of all was that I'd been trapped by an odd series of circumstances into agreeing to have dinner with a person I'd been avoiding literally for years.</p>

<p>His name was Sy Cross.</p>

<p>At one time he'd been a very close friend of mine. In fact, he was the only one who's attitude toward didn't change when my boxing career took off. His opinion of it never changed, either, even when it was obvious I had lots of money form it. When I'd known Sy, he was a risk taker, stoic, with few ambitions, but he always did have a taste for trouble. But then something happened to Sy. He vanished one day, returned a week later. My brother Orion saw him standing in the middle of a park once, staring up at the sky, unmoving or something like that. Obviously, something terrible had happened to Sy. The whole idea of meeting him made me very nervous. I mean, i wasn't really up to that sort of thing... I had problems of my own. I knew i couldn't help him, not right now.  </p>

<p>I received a letter from him one day, a handwritten letter, not something I'm used to getting anymore. In it, he asked to meet me, here. I was surprised, and asked that I tell no one. Fine with me, i'm not eager to let others know of my relationship with Sy, I think my sponsors would agree. </p>

<p>Shit, there he is.</p>

<p>"Wow. You look well."</p>
<p>"Try honesty."</p>
<p>"Um. You look like shit?</p>
<p>"And I feel like it too."</p>

<p>A restaurant, good, good. This place doesnt look too dodgy, it's well-lit too. Actually, that is suspicious for other reasons... I've never seen Sy eat out, or in any normal human setting. </p>

<p>"Buy me coffee?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yea. Sure."</p>

<p>Sy doesn't work, and never has money. He doesn't have a cellphone, a car, and as far as i know, he's got no bank account either. I bet that if you looked at the tags at his shirt, that you'd find them blank. Sy, without ties and tags.</p>

<p>We walked inside, taking a seat the nearest table to the entrance. I always do that, as if I need the door close in case I need to leave quickly. It's silly, really, I don't know why I do that. Paranoia? Probably.</p>

<p>"Was wondering if you'd come."</p>

<p>*waiter comes*</p>

<p>"Two coffees, thx." *waiter leaves*. "Well I'm here. So, how are you, really."</p>
<p>"No, uou want to know why I asked you here."<p>
<p>"Sorry, I forgot you hate social niceties. Please don't say not to say sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't say please, either. Did you ever wander into the Great Land?"</p>
<p>"The Great Land? That's um, way north isn't it? No roads there, as far as I know. Very cold too."</p>
<p>"Once you're past the last major city, you enter a forest of those trees, you know, the ones with needles instead of leaves. I don't know, I'm no botanist, you know what I mean..."</p>
<p>"You went there. Really. How did you manage that?"</p>
<p>"Bummed a ride with hydroplant workers up to Rocky Point. Walked after that, no roads beyond that point."</p>
<p>"So you went to the woods. Why d'you do that? Didn't peg you for the outdoorsy type."</p>
<p>"I woke up one day feeling real sick. Couldn't eat, or sleep. No matter what I did, this... this sick feeling was there, preying on me, day and night. It got to a point when I couldn't tell when I awake. I had these mad fever dreams, I felt like I was being devoured from the inside, like termites hollowing out wood. I got this crazy idea in my head then, to go north. Just, WAY north. No one cared or asked what i was doing, no one paid any attention. Everyone's so wrapped up in their lives, commanded by their screens. Anyway, I went north until I got high up, to a place with more trees than people. There, people saw me, like, actually saw what I had in me. This guy who was carrying groceries on the street stopped dead in his tracks, dropped his bags and grabbed me. He told me I was sick, because in the south the land is sick."</p>
<p>"ARE you sick?"</p>
<p>"We're all sick. Anyway, she said going north was a good idea. So, I walked into the forest. I saw pines, spruces and balsam firs. I never learned their names but I knew them? These trees, had adapted to survive long and cold winters. If you look at a needle, they've got no sap, and because they don't, they don't freeze. The ground under my feet was permanently frozen, it felt hard, under my feet. As i walked on, i stumbled into other places, that felt different to walk on. I bent downa and started digging in the earth, I saw a layer of bedrock just under the soil. Around here, when it rains, or whatever, the water just drains down into the earth, but because the ground is either frozen, or made of rock, the water doesn't drain, it stays in the top layers of soil. I saw a lot of these shallow bogs, that look like they're solid, but they're covered in moss and shortgrass. If you walk on them, the ground feels spongy, and wet. It's here, that I saw one."</p>
- Saw... what?
- Well, I walked up to a large recess in the ground, forming a pool of deep water. A branch was sticking out, it looked like a hand, covered in moss. I walked close, to look at it. Then i slipped, and slid halfway into the pool. The water was so cold it hurt. I pulled myself out... Then, I looked up, the hand had receded into the water, and a head stood in its place. A giant head. You know how around in any public park, there's all statues of historical figures, but their proportions are bigger than us, much bigger. The head in the water was that large, covered in moss and mud, but i could see bits of pale skin underneath. Its eyes were a deep black, like a shark, focused. I was like, shit, this thing is PISSED.
- WHat the fuck, what was it?
- You know what, ain't just stories. These things, they exist. Anyway, I couldn't move. Was frozen in place, literally. That water was damn cold, and i was tired. So i just looked at it, and said 'hey'
- You look in the eyes of a supposed being, whose existence predates that of our own...and say.. 'hey'.
- What the fuck was I supposed to say? Sorry for the agricultural revolution? I was freezing and near mad, that's all i could say. ANyway. I sat there, struck dumb, dumbstruck... whichever, then it rose out of the water, like a pillar. Then it twisted its neck to look down at me, and it began to speak, what came out was an awful gurgle... then water started to come out of its throat, unending. Like a fountain. It cleared its throat, of water and fish, whatever the hell was in there, licked its lips, and said...'English'. Its voice was cavernous. It closed its eyes, taking a moment... then upon re-opening them again it smiled, broadly. Its teeth were discoloured. I wasn't really scared up until that point, like shit, its gonna eat me or something. its gonna happen, im going to be food. What's scary, is how we think we somehow lie outside the food chain. We're above every other creature on earth, that we can't be eaten, we won't be. That is something that happens to wild animals, not us. We are above being someone else's lunch. I felt real small then, like a rabbit in the clutch of a hawk. Then, it just laughed, a croaking sort of laugh. 'The ones who move rivers, who have no respect for the trees, nor the birds, nor any other.' I was like... wait up, i don't do shit, i don't even pay my taxes. As far as im concerned, the birds and I are, we're cool. Also, I hate people. I was like, you hate em, i hate em. We agree on that. It looked at me, smiling still. 'you came here to die' it said, it should have been a question, but it sure as hell wasn't. I thought about that for a second, time slowing to a stop as i processed all of it. I thought, maybe i did come here to die. Maybe that's what i wanted, why else would anyone run screaming into the wild and cold? It then moved forward, i felt my heart trying to leap right out of my chest as it slapped its hand over me. I shit you not, it was as large as my chest. I was pinned down, back wet with moss. Then it neared its face toward me. 'We are but dust and shadows. Enjoy life. There's plenty of time to be dead.' It stared at me long after that, looking tired, then it went to lie back down into the pool, closing its eyes. I got up, half forgetting i was frozen, and i walked away. I thought i was gonna die then too, hands and feet numb.. next thing i knew, i was back in a car, wrapped in a heavy coat, speeding down the road. 
- How is any of that true.
- Why would I lie.
- So what, you still sick?
- Yea, but I'm gonna cultivate it, like a garden herb. 
- That is vague enough to be inoffensive, but knowing you...
