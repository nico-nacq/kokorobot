    <ul class="bullet">
        <li><b>Age</b>: 26</li>
        <li><b>Nickname</b>: Pen, short for Penny</li>
        <li><b>Alignment</b>: Lawful neutral</li>

        <li><b>Appearance</b>: Token has light and spiky blonde hair, brushed back and away from his face. Being athletic, he's all muscles, wide in the shoulders with strong arms. Token is 5'9, and wears fitted long-sleeves shirts, jeans and running shoes; he often wears a red sports jacket overtop. He bears a deep cut at his lip, is missing two fingers on his left hand and his right hand up to the elbow is a prosthetic.</li>

<hr>
<p>Token is a professional boxer, known country-wide for his exceptional skills. He is generous and well-liked. He has many good relationships with a lot of people, but hardly any close friendships. Token avoids it. His personal space is his own, and he allows no one else to dig too deep. He's only had aromantic relationships with others.</p>

<p>He is very strong, and spends most his time working out.</p>

<p>The more time passes, the more Token struggles to mute his anger. He spends too much time inside his own head, thinking unhealthy and unproductive thoughts, wondering what his life would have been like if his father hadn't done what he did. Token never allows himself to be happy, something that <a href="sy.html">Sy</a> never fails to remind him.</p>

<p>Token lost a section of his arm after he veered into another lane, his driving impaired by his overuse of opioids. He was given a prosthetic by <a href="nemerald.html">Nemerald</a>. This prosthetic mirrors the weight and length of his other arm while being safe (and fair) against other opponents. It mimics the anatomical shape of a closed fist and has the same impact as a human hand, while remaining durable during rounds of sparring.</p>

<p>He suffered some abused as child, he has worked all his life to bury the memories and helped to fuel his addiction to opioids.</p>
