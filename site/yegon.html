<hr>
<p>Yegon (Yay-gone) is part of the <b>Ars Goetia</b>, he is one of <a href="seir.html">Seir</a>'s main grunts. He suffers from an impulse control disorder, destroying property and setting fires, an affliction that Seir is more than happy to utilize, at the cost of Yegon's mental health.</p>
<p>Yegon is a trickster, he likes to play games and hates being serious. He is kind, but not all care for his tricks. Yegon is a master at masking his emotions, to the point where many think he's incapable of feeling anything. That couldn't be farther from the truth. When alone, Yegon's demeanor changes, and this is usually the time when his urge to destroy kicks in.</p>
<h3>Past</h3>
<p>Yegon used to have another name, Azi, but he abandoned it after his time at the Liskar detention center. Azi was part of the Ars Goetia with Kaddali, together with others, they would destroy racist human-led businesses and sabotage logging machinery intruding on their home lands. Kaddali and he were lovers, they met during protests in the city and created the group together.</p>
<p>The Solo Devs had a run-in with the K-Firsts, a hategroup that targets hegatas, after they came to intercept their 'human pride' parade in town. The two groups locked fists, Azi was separated, and got shot at close range below the left eye. Kaddali and the others thought him dead. After the police arrived both groups fled. Yegon did not die, but lost the eye, hearing in the adjacent ear due to stray bullet and bone fragments. His short term memory and intellectual capacity was also impaired, he had to re-learn how to do many things. A hegata body heals faster than a human body, and after a short time he could function on his own, but was then sentenced to 10 years in the Liskar detention center for his past violent actions. This detention center was the country's way of assimilating hegatas, half-demons, into human society. This practice was done, hypocritically, under the guise of rehabilitation, but the real role of these programs was to instill despair in hegata dissenters. The detention center cut the tip of Yegon's ears off to make him more 'human-like', a barbaric practice common in those days. His otoplasty was evidently botched. Yegon went hungry most nights, he was severely beaten for the slightest infraction.</p>
<p>After a fire decimated his wing of the detention center, he escaped with another inmate named Ikkard. Together, they lived outside of society, stealing from cars and re-selling items at pawn shops for cash. Ikkard met up with a Solomon's Devils member then, and suggested they join up. Azi found out this was his former group, the Ars Goetia. They had branched off the main group after too much in-fighting and Kaddali was leading this new branch. When Kaddali saw Azi, he was of course thrilled, but soon realized that time and external circumstance (head trauma) had changed Azi too much. He called himself Yegon, and would not respond to Azi. Yegon wasn't as quickly-witted as Azi, it took time to recall information, he laughed at anything, and he looked entirely different. Kaddali was crushed, and Yegon, heartbroken. He left a year into his stay with the Solo D's, unable to deal with Kaddali's tamtrums. Kaddali had become more radical in his thinking, and hated humans more than ever for what they had done to them both.</p>
<p>Yegon left to join the first branch of the Ars Goetia, leaving Kaddali and his old life behind.</p></main><footer><p><a href='about.html'>Rekka Bellum</a> © 2009-2022 <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/#random'>Webring</a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek'>Mastodon</a> <a href='politics.html'>Politics</a></p></footer></body></html>
