    <h2>What is Hakum</h2>
    <p>Hakum is a free-form comic, drawn by hand and published online. Hakum follows two Hegata groups of monkeywrenchers. The two groups are The <a href='solomons_devils.html' class='local'>solomons devils</a> (Solo Devs) and the <a href='ars_goetia.html' class='local'>ars goetia</a>, as they fight to protect the Taiga from humans. Both have similar visions of the future, but bicker on how to best build/destroy the road to get there. The story touches on mental health, and conservancy. Both the Solo D's and the Ars want to keep the Taiga intact to keep the land healthy and uncorrupted by human activity</p></columns>

<h3>On worldbuilding</h3>
<p>It is not easy to flesh out stories. It is a fun, and highly iterative process. Nothing is set in stone, drawing out bits of the comic does not mean the story will remain the same. It is a way of playing with the characters, to get to know them and to further develop the world. This is what this comic is for me, drawing them out in various non-sequential situations is a way to discover a workable story. Keep this in mind while browsing this page.</p><p>"Tolkien, for all his vaunted designs, only got to The Good Stuff when he was IN it, really working the text of the novels. He could not worldbuild his way into a workable story; he had to muddle and discover and revise, just like the rest of us." [<a href='https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/ring-got-good/' target='_target'>Source</a>].</p>

<h3><a id='monkeywrencher'>What is monkeywrenching?</h3>

<p>"Monkeywrenching" is based on the US idiom "to throw a monkey wrench into..." which means to sabotage something. The term was coined by Edward Abbey (from the book The Monkeywrench Gang) and its come to mean, besides sabotage and damage to machines, any sabotage, activism, law-making, or law-breaking to preserve wilderness, wild spaces and ecosystems.</p>

<h3><a id='hegata'>Hegatas</a></h3>

<p>Hegatas are descendants of the Katkum, a race whose time on earth preceeds humans. Some pure blood Katkum remain, but most lie dormant in the Taiga.</p>

<p>Hegatas live longer than humans, but not as long as their ancestors. A hegata insult for humans is half-lifers, or near-deads, as hegatas typically live twice as long and age twice as slowly (they age at a regular rate until their early teens, when it slows down). Some hegatas can heal their bodies quickly, some are very tall, very strong, others have other more unique talents...</p>

<h3><a id='lexicon'>Lexicon</a></h3>

<p>Hakum is a hegata word to mean "heart of the taiga", or "soul of the forest". Taiga refers to primary forests. Hegata means "secondary growth", in reference to the fact that the main characters of Hakum don't live as long as the Katkum. An "Alekum", is a Katkum that has abandoned their former body for that of an animal.</p>

<p>Hegata speak Kataluk. Here are some of the Kataluk words mentioned in the comic sequences below...</p>

<ul>
<li>Skol&atilde;π - thank you.</li>
<li>Oteyo - hello.</li>
<li>Ha'pa - heart of a woman.</li>
<li>Ha'yat - heart of neither a man or a woman.</li>
<li>Stnectotke - stupid, or ridiculous.</li>
<li>J&eacute; na - Aren't I?</li>
<li>Koπzí - friends(but more than this), to come from the same tree(same community)</li>
<li>Recπa&atilde;t - alone</li>
<li>Betna - wish/pray</li>
<li>Seke- to do</li>
<li>Betnaseke - please, lit: to do pray/wish</li>
<li>Katkum - people of the taiga</li>
<li>Eiketk&atilde;t - ancient markings on hegata indicative of a strong Katkum spirit, lit: forest oath stripes</li>
<li>Youtka - war paint</li>
<li>Gon - bird</li>
<li>Zí - tree.</li>
<li>Haka - growing.</li>
<li>Kit&atilde;πl&eacute; - correct.</li>
<li>So&otilde;tket - to understand.</li>
<li>Le - appended to words, for asking questions.</li>
<li>Ti - when appended to words, means 'to be'. Ex: Kit&atilde;πl&eacute;-ti!, you are correct.</li>
<li>O&otilde;kle - sibling, or someone you share feelings with and that you are close to.</li>
<li>O&otilde;kledo&utilde; - term of endearment, to mean little sibling.</li>
<li>Do&utilde; - appended to names, or words to mean 'little', or used for someone for whom you care about. Ex: Daedou (Dae being a name).</li>

<h3><a id='comic'>Comic</a></h3>

<p>For now, the comic is non-linear, and I update it sporadically. The comic is drawn by hand, and inked with a dip pen. Shading is done with halftones handmade in Gimp. Because I have to resize the comics for the web, the haftone isn't as apparent (every page is 25% of its original size). Previews below are 50% of the original file size.</p>
