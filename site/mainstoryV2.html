Never tell anyone where you buried it."

Token nodded. "This way," Sy said, "you can comeback without using the portal. If you think someone found out where you buried it, move it."

"Is this something I have to do in the real world too? Like, to go back there?"

Sy nodded, "yes. Choose well because you'll appear there next, make sure it can't be moved, or change it before it happens."

"What if the mark is destroyed," Token asked.

"Then you can't leave unless you take a physical portal back."

<h3>Tar boy</h3>

Sy arrived at the edge of a desert, though he was a little hesitant to wander around over there. The weather was warm in this area and the last thing he wanted was to get dehydrated. Now that he thought about it he hadn't planned this out very well. As he was about to leave he noticed a dark mass up on a hill of bright yellow sand. Sy thought it might be Seir, so he went ahead to find out, but it was a little boy. The boy looked young, he dark hair with a face covered in odd markings. He was white as a sheet, while his eyes seemed like two dark holes, sunken, endless. The boy looked up at Sy and smiled with red teeth.

Sy was a little freaked out, and was wondering whether or not he should leave but then spoke aloud. "Do you know someone named Seir?"

The boy looked amused. His black tongue licked his top lip, a tar like liquid came spilling out the sides of his mouth. "Yes." He said in a strange double-voice, the black tar sliding down to cover the front of his chest.

"Take me to him then" Sy said, trying to mask his fear.

"Yesss." The boy said with a gurgle as he walked off.

Sy didn't dare ask for his name, he just started to refer to him as "Yess" because so far, he hadn't heard him say anything else.

The boy walked over to a darker spot in the sand, and as he did, he began to sink... grinning at Sy as he did as if he was daring him to follow. "Yea right." Sy said, but before he knew it another spot had formed under him and sucked him in. He fell through a layer of sand and then down into a sort of cave. There was no sign of the boy anywhere. The cave resembled a bunker. It was one big room. He wondered where the boy had gone, and finally he spotted him hiding in a dark corner, the tip of his shoes sticking out into the only spot of light in the room. The light He was about to talk when a larger form stepped in behind him. A set of white eyes and a larger pair of legs swung over the boy and stepped into the light. 

A tall man stood there, he had broad shoulders with a matching chest and shoulder long, straight, red hair. He didnt look very happy to see him. He frowned as he suddenly shot towards him like a bull, his arm pushing forward and grabbing both the base of his chin and the most of his neck with his large hand. He slammed him back hard against a stone wall, cracks forming from under him. Sy's eyes widened as he found himself pinned to the wall by this angry giant.

Then the man spoke aloud and clear. He knew other words than yes. "We didn't mind you coming here when you were a stupid human child... and even later when you grew up and became a stupid human man it was tolerable... but you collaborating with that fiend..." the man grabbed harder onto his neck and suddenly flipped him upside down, like his neck was nailed to the wall... the man's second hand grabbed his crotch to hold him upside down in place on the wall. Sy squealed as he gripped hard.

"We've been waiting to meet with you for a while. We were hoping to meet with Nemerald himself, but now we have you and you will help us kill Nemerald," he said.

"Why do you want him dead?" Sy asked.

"The door between your world and ours used to be open, but Nemerald and some others decided to limit access and we think that this isn't right." Vincent said.

"There's a lot of you guys over on the other side though," Sy said.

"That was pre-Nemerald. But they've all bonded with humans now, for generations... a human idea no doubt, to weaken us, to reduce us to live pathetic half lives."

"I don't give a shit," Sy said, "about anything. I'll do whatever, but you've got to give me free reign over this place. No one fucks with me, ever."

Vincent smirked, "fine."

"Nemerald isn't easy to off though, and there's no way i can get you guys in there... that place is protected, no joke."

"Oh, we've got a way. You'll carry this one with you." Vincent said, indicating Yess. Yess had moved out of the corner and was now standing right next to him. "He will do everything. All you have to do is act normal."

"Kozi's systems will detect him, won't work."

Suddenly, Yess touched the side of Sy's face and began to seep into him, black strands melting from Yess's body and covering Sy's skin. Sy screamed but he couldn't move a muscle, his skin was burning and his insides felt like they were being pushed around. Then all the pain left him, and he could see clearly again. 

"It'll work," Vincent said. "Yess will lay dormant, and in that state Nemerald won't read him. But to call him out to do the work, you've got to hurt yourself, and I don't mean pinching your arm." Saying this, Vincent found the blade in Sy's back pocket and pulled it out. "A deep, deep cut will do it."

"That sounds insane," Sy said. "Is this somekind of twisted way of getting me to kill myself? You hate humans that bad eh?"

"While he's inside you your pain will be his, and because it is he won't let it last," Vincent assured him.

----------------------------------------

Nemerald was looking over some documents when Sy returned. "Anything to report?" he asked, like he did everyday. "No," Sy said. He walked near Nemerald, eyeing him carefully and looked around the room. Jak was in his room, Caleb was in the real world. Sy took his knife then, and cut his hand open. Nothing happened. He cursed inwardly, then drove the blade in deeper, and deeper. He'd expected it to hurt, but now found it difficult to be quiet. Nemerald heard him, then saw his bleeding hand "what are you...?" When Nemerald said this, Sy felt a burning sensation in his chest. He put a hand over the painful spot, and bent forward, like he was about to vomit. Nemerald got up to look him over, but then saw Sy spitting out black pools of liquid. Before he could fully react the pool of blood shot towards him, like soft black icicles, and latched around his throat, squeezing. Nemerald couldn't move, or breathe. He fell back into his chair, toppling it before rolling on the floor, helpless. Sy was on his knees, hurt from the pain of Yess's exit.

Jak arrived into the room then, seeing what was happening he drew shapes in the air and muttered incantations quickly and a diamond formed around Nemerald and the creature. The diamond began to pulse rapidly, and with every pulse the black liquid seemed to lift from Nemerald's body. All the while Jak continued to chant and moved his fingers wildly, he then began to shout words until finally Yess lifted from Nemerald's skin and lay fixed on the inner wall of the diamond, it appeared to be boiling, bubbles forming around the surface. The diamond imprisoning Yess lifted away from Nemerald, effectively separating them. Nemerald was on the ground, he had terrible wounds all over his neck, jaw and upper torso. He lay still, eyes locked onto the diamond. He spotted Sy then, running outside of Circa and once out there, he vanished.

"TABARNAK" Jak yelled, he could do nothing. He was too busy trying to contain Yess, and Nemerald was out of commission.

0--------------------------------------

Sy appeared back in his old room, at his mum's house. He had left the item in a closet, tucked under the floorboards. The house was abandoned, wrecked. His room was empty, ransacked with graffit everywhere. The rest of the house wasn't as damaged. Sy made his way to the living room. He could guess that his mum had left the place, he hoped she was somewhere, alive and well. 

Sy didn't want to be here. This is not what he wanted. He was certain that Yess would have killed Nemerald, he'd undestimated Jak's power. For now, he knew he was safe because Nemerald never left the mountain, and Jak was not allowed through the portal. He waited until night time to leave, and when he did he used the back door. He slipped out, and wandered the streets of Montore.

Sy had been carrying his old wallet with him this entire time, he found a few dollars in it. The first thing he did was try and get a drink at a bar, he desperately needed it. He took a seat at the bar, being around a lot of people was strange, he was used to just being around Nemerald and Caleb... and all of the others in the other world. He felt annoyed, and people were loud. Though it was warm in here so he figured he'd try and stick around for a little while longer, "A beer please" he asked the bartender. 

"Got some ID?" she replied. 

Sy groaned. "A coke then" he said, he forgot he didn't want to show an ID with his name. And anyway, the damned thing was expired. He found some peanuts on the bar top and dumped the entire bowl in his hands and then transfered it all to his mouth.

 he noticed a blonde haired boy sitting at a table with friends. 

"Orion!" a boy said, "Another drink?"

The blonde boy's name was Orion. Orion as in, Token's younger brother perhaps? He was in his old neighborhood after all so the idea that he was now sitting in a bar with him wasnt incredibly far-fetched. He tried to listen in on their conversation to try and see if this really was him. After a while the group left the bar and Sy decided to follow, its not like he had anywhere to be. He followed them over to a liquor store and then over to a building where he guessed, they were going to stay. Orion drunkily pulled his keys out of his back pocket to open the door so this meant that he lived here. Once the boys got past the entrance and past the locked door he went in to make sure that it was him indeed. He began picking at the locks for the mailboxes, prying each of them open to see if a letter inside one of them was addressed to orion mintenko. After checking a few, he was forced to leave as the janitor walked in to see him snooping through the mail. Sy felt a little silly, following that dumb kid around like that. Even if it was him, what good would it do? Then... he thought of something... if he was sure this was Orion, it would mean he would be able to lead him to his brother Token. He had a bone to pick with Token.

Sy spent the night outside, and while keeping watch he eventually fell asleep. He woke up the next morning with a start, someone was standing over him and poking him with his foot "Water?" Orion offered him. Sy jumped a little at the sight of him, and couldn't understand why he was trying to give him water but without really thinking he grabbed it and took a swig. Though when the liquid hit his mouth he spat it out coughing.

Orion laughed, "Vodka. Sorry, that was a terrible joke to make." He glared up at him, but then tilted his cap down to cast a shadow over the top of his face. Not like he needed everyone to know he was back. Though this last gesture had been rather useless, while he'd been sleeping Orion had had more than enough time to look at his face and to figure out who he was. Why hadnt Orion freaked out? For many reasons really, one of them being that he believed everyone had a good heart and had their reasons for doing what they did. So he wouldn't just rat him out to the cops, not yet anyway. Besides, he was curious to know what had happened to him and if this man lying down before him was indeed the infamous Sy Cross.

Sy frowned at the boy

Orion grinned. "You looked like you needed a drink," of course Sy said nothing, he just stood up with his back to him, dusting the dirt off his jacket and pants.

Sy felt like a fool for thinking Orion wouldn't recognize him. He couldn't look at him, he just kept his back to him.

"Come after midnight, around the building there's a back entrance. Knock 4 times, I'll come and get you," he said before leaving.

Sy didn't know what to do, why would Orion invite him over? At this point though, he didn't have anything in his life so why not? 

Later that night, he showed up at the back of Orion's building, he hesitated to knock. Before he could, he was pushed forward into the door, body flat up against it. "Don't move, and keep your mouth shut," the voice ordered. Sy of course had no desire to be caught, he pushed back and tried to get free of this guy but couldn't. Before he knew it he was on his knees, face against the door still and someone was binding his hands together behind his back. Sy couldn't yell for help, who comes to the aid of a murderer? He even had his mouth bound up with a piece of tape.

The door opened finally and he was pushed inside, dragged around in the dark and past a few more doors. Then he was thrown onto something soft, a couch. He could hear people bickering in the dark, shadows moved around him. He waited, sitting on the couch... someone would talk to him eventually.

"You hungry?" someone squeaked at him, then he heard shuffling and cursing. "If he's hungry? Fuck's sake!" the other person whispered.

"Well what are we supposed to do now? Just whisper in the dark like idiots? He knows I live here."

The other person sighed, "fine," a light flicked open, a small lamp just beside where he was sitting and the person lighting it was, of course, Orion.

"Hey!" He said, with a guilty smirk.

Sy could see there was someone else there, standing further in the back in the dark. He didn't seem to want to come closer, he just paced around wildly, from the living room to the kitchen and back.

"So, are you hungry?" Orion asked Sy.

Sy nodded, eager to have that tape off his lips.

"I'll get you a plate of something," Orion said.

He re-heating some curry and rice on the stovetop. Soon, the smell enveloped the room, escaping into the living room. Sy's stomach rumbled loudly, he hadn't eaten any real food in days. Once the food was warm, Orion transfered it to a bowl and returned to the living room with the meal. He set the curry down on the coffee table, and took a seat next to Sy. "Sorry about that, we didn't know how you'd react," Orion said, peeling the tape off. Before Sy could speak, he brought a spoonful of curry near his mouth, "this is how it's going to be for now," he said apologetically, he knew Token preferred that his hands stay tied up.

Sy shrugged, he was starving and tired and was in no mood to fight. He took a first bite. This was the first warm, and aromatic meal he'd had since leaving the real world. The experience was so intense that he had to stop in mid-chew. He hadn't eaten food like this in ages, all Nemerald served were something he called 'nutri-blocks'. The food was always the same, dry, bland and full of nutrients, or so he said. Sy hated mealtime, so much that he'd lost a ton of weight over the years. Eating had become a chore. Sy wasn't a food connoisseur, but he missed the experience of food, of being able to detect subtleties in a meal, to have flavor come at you in waves. He chewed, paused, and swallowed, spoonful after spoonful until the bowl was empty. "Is there more?" He asked. 

Orion smiled, "that was a leftover, so no, but I can make something else." He got up and went into the kitchen to see what he could make real fast. "How about grilled cashew cheese? That's all I got, we don't eat dairy here. Trust me though, it's real good." Sy was salivating at the thought of it. "I'm good with anything."

"What did you eat in Circa anyway?" Orion asked.

Sy glanced over at the dark silhouette by the window, he stopped pacing but stood there, staring outside. "Just dry stuff," he said, but then he realized he hadn't actually said he'd been in Circa. 

"Where else, really," Orion said, "if I'd done something terrible myself, that's where I'd go."

"Got any soda? Aching for something fizzy and sweet." Sy asked, eager to stop talking his life in Circa.

Orion poked his head out of the kitchen holding an orange soda, "yep!" 

The silhouette darted from his spot near the window and tore the can from Orion's hands, and without warning, he tossed it over to Sy. The can hit the wall just a few inches from his head and exploded, the orange soda came shooting out and sprayed Sy in the back of the head.

"He doesn't get any more treats," the silhouette said.

Sy stood up, his neck sticky with soda. “Damn. What a sad, sad waste." Since his hands were bound, he couldn't wipe it off. He made a face as it streamed down his back, entering the back of his pants. 

Token finally emerged from the shadows. There he was, his childhood friend, the boy who he'd last seen on the ground. He was very tall now, with wide shoulders and a thin waist. Token had an athletic build, with well-toned arms and legs. His hair was the same, spiky and blonde. He bore a scar on his lip, a thin line that traversed both the top and bottom lip. He had listless eyes, the rest of him appeared strong and confident, but his eyes betrayed his true self. Token was a shell of a human, and had been for a long, long time.

"Oh I've been waiting a long time for this," Sy said, "is this why I'm tied up? You're going to turn me in to the authorities or something? You're going to give me what I deserve?"

Images of himself covered in blood flooded into his mind. Token remembered being on the ground, bleeding in the mud while staring into Mackenzie's dead eyes. It felt like it lasted a lot longer than it did. He remembered being interrogated by policemen, avoiding Miles, leaving school. Token had every reason to hate Sy, every reason. He had to bring Sy to justice, or at least, bring him to Nemerald. He too didn't wish to take him to the cops, he didnt want the whole "Cross murder" to come up in the papers again, he didn't want people asking him about it anymore. He did not want to let this taint his career, or his success. He wanted to get rid of that stain on his record, and for a while he had succeeded, but now that Sy was back he was worried that all of his hard work had been for nothing. It's like the real Token was still back there, alone in the mud.

"So, what you gonna do with me?" Sy asked, Orion looked at Token, wondering the same thing.

"You ruined my life," Token said, scornfully.

"Your life was already ruined," Sy spat.

Token's face was red with anger, he rushed for Sy and pushed him up against a wall.

"Oh fuck you, you're the asshole. You just couldn't let me get away eh? Even after I offered to help your sorry ass..." Sy said, then looking at Token's expression he deduced that not much had changed since their time. "He's still coaching you isn't he? That's sick. Do you really hate yourself that much?"

Orion tried to stop him, but Token shoved him away, then he began to throw punch, after punch. All of his pent up rage, his fear and his sadness came spilling out. Token punched so hard and so much that Orion had to squeeze himself inbetween to get him to stop, and that worked well ennough. Token would never lay a hand on his brother.

"Breathe," Orion said as he held his shoulders. "Sit, way waaaay over there, and breathe, 3 seconds, hold your breath, 3 seconds, exhale." He walked his brother over to a couch opposite to where Sy had been. Token was breathing heavily, but he was beginning to calm down.

Sy was in a sorry state, sitting on the floor, eyeing Token. He didn’t say anything, knowing that anything could set him off again. 

Orion felt like the only adult in the room, he hated feeling that way. He went over to Sy and undid his cuffs, carefully. "I'm taking him to the bedroom," he told Token, "everything will be okay." He helped Sy up. "Can you stand?" he asked him. 

“Yea, yea,” Sy said, getting up. He walked him to his bedroom, and laid out a sheet over it to keep the blood stains off and then helped Sy onto it. “Lie down,” Orion said, he then left and returned with some painkillers, “and take 2 of these, every 4 hours. I’ll get you some water.” Token had tons of meds, in his line of work these were indispensable. Orion also brought some cold compresses for his bruises. He helped Sy out of his shirt and began to inspect his wounds, to make sure nothing was broken. "Shit," Orion said, his finger near his left clavicle, "you've got a broken clavicle, I think. Bone hasn't broken through though." 

"Great," Sy said.

Orion knew he couldn't take Sy to a hospital, Sy had no form of ID of any kind and it was too much of a risk. "I've got some training, did a first-aid course a year ago for my work," Orion said, "you'll have to lie here awhile, try not to lift your left arm." A little while later the pills began to take effect, and Sy went to sleep. Orion washed some of the red from his face while he slept, cleaning up some of the wounds as well.

"You went too far," Orion told his brother, moving back into the living room. Token hadn't moved all this time, he just sat there, focusing on his breathing with his eyes closed.

Token opened his eyes, "I hate him... so, so much," he said.

"Now you're even."

"Not even close," Token said, through gritted teeth.

"Be glad I met him out there, cause I think he was trying to find you." Orion sighed, not certain how he was able to keep calm in this moment. A violent man lay in his bed, and before him stood a ticking time bomb. "Oof..." Orion said, fanning himself, trying to think on what to do next.

"Why the fuck are you being so kind to him?" Token spat out then, he was so angry he appeared deranged.

"Did you see how terrible he looks? He said Circa was better, but he's terribly skinny, pale... I think the years he spent away were punishment enough,” Orion had seen scars on Sy's arms, perhaps things were worse than he'd first let on. "And you know, I don't want to set him off. He's in our appartment, I'm sure I don't have to remind you." Orion glanced at Token then, "how do you think we should handle this? Police?"

Token shook his head, the very thought of the story coming back into the papers made him anxious "No. Reporters will want to talk to me, and I just can't deal with that right now." Token got up then, grabbed his coat and left the appartment. 

Orion sighed, he let Sy sleep for a little while. He stayed in bed for a full 24 hours. Token had not come home, which was just as well. The following morning, Orion went to check up on him and saw that he was gone. "Uh, what?" He looked elsewhere in the house for him, "Sy?"

Sy walked out of the kitchen then, eating a banana. "Where the cops at?" He asked him, eyesbrows raised while chewing. "Thought I'd wake up in jail."

Orion eyed him carefully, he was holding it with his left hand. He also could not see any bruising near where his bone had cracked. He moved closer and hit the underside of his elbow, to see if Sy would react. "That... doesn't hurt?"

"No," Sy said, eating through the banana. 

"It's healed," Orion said, eyes wide. "How? That makes NO sense."

"Aren't you glad I'm all better?" Sy said, returning to the kitchen to grab another fruit.

Orion followed him, looking him over, noticing that the swelling on his face was also way down, almost gone. "Well, yea but..."

"Christ. You got anything other than fruit?"

"I'll make you some rice with a fuck ton of lentils," Orion said. He made a mental note of keeping this detail secret to Token, the last thing he'd want to hear is that Sy can't stay hurt.

"So, no cops?" Sy said.

"No cops."

"Aren't you scared?" He asked, tearing out a large chunk of apple.

"Of you? Hell no," Orion said with a laugh, reaching over to pat him on the head, but Sy slapped his hand away before it could made contact. "But Token's real nervous around you, he'll be real easy to piss off so don't engage him, and most important of all don't hurt him."

Sy finished the apple then, eating around the core, until only the very hard bits and seeds were left. "Or else?"

"Or else nothing. We won't rat you out, and I'll make sure he doesn't mess with you. Plus I'll throw food and board, that's a hell of a deal." Orion said, crossing his arms over his chest.

"He's the reason I've got to hide," he said, smirking at Orion.

"You put him in an impossible position," Orion reminded him. "C'mon, I'll throw in the occasional joint."

Sy thought about everything for a second. He could stay here a little while, it would give him time to get used to being in a city again, and there was free food here... and a warm, clean bed. "I'll stay for a bit." 

Orion nodded. "Token will likely be gone for a few days, to avoid you. He works out with his friend Mari a lot, he stays at her place sometimes. Now enough about that. Go take a shower, you have red on you."

<h3>Let's talk about Token</h3>

Everyday Orion would keep talking to Sy, asking little questions, forcing him to do things around the appartment. In truth, Orion found him impossible to live with. Sy would take, and give nothing back. After a week, they'd learned to live alongside one another. Orion had people over often, during such times Sy stayed in Token's room. Sy didn't mind, he wasn't exactly eager to make friends. He read books, and when he felt restless he did chin-ups using Token's horizontal bar, or used his weights. Sy never turned on the TV, he listened to the radio sometimes but switched channels as soon as he heard human voices. 

He went out to hang on the balcony at night. Orion wondered what he was thinking about. He didn't appear lonely, or miserable, but then again he was hard to read. One evening, he joined him on the balcony and asked him outright. "Are you happy?"

Sy laughed, "happiness is an impossible, unnattainable ideal," he said, lifting his legs and hanging them on the railing, "and pursuing it will only hurt you."

"But..."

"'but' is your positive defence mechanism kicking in," Sy continued, "I get it though, if people didn't believe happiness was a thing you could get then a lot more people would kill themselves off for relief. I'm okay with my pain though, I think about it as often as I can, and because I do I'm capable of bearing the reality of a disillusioned and concrete life."

"Christ, that is grim," Orion said, blinking, processing it all.

Sy smiled, "Token's full of bone-deep suffering and endless mourning. Things will never get better, ‘It is bad today, and it will be worse tomorrow...’ accept that life is hell, and be free."

"So you get up in the morning tihnking 'well, today is going to suck'."

"I get up thinking I'm going to keep myself alive again today, I'm gonna eat, drink, sleep. There might come a time when dying will seem ideal, if ever my reality becomes too unbearable say. But for now I am curious enough to want to stay alive."

"Not everyone can sit with their pain," Orion said.

"I've seen Token's collection of meds, if he takes those and stays numb then he will never learn."

Orion took a deep breath. "I know there are things in his life that he needs to deal with, it's just... difficult you know? Killing people isn't a solution."

"You're wrong," Sy said.

"How so?" 

"Some people just need to die, that’s it.”

"Not everyone needs to get along, but death? It’s so...permanent, and cruel."

“There are a lot of evil fuckers out there. Allowing some people to live is in itself more cruel. They'll live for make life for others.” Sy proposed.

“It's too easy to view others as evil, it just makes it easier to hurt them. It’s convenient. Was Mackenzie evil?”

"Yea,” Sy said, thinking for a moment, “...he sucked.”

Orion sighed, “you took his life because he sucked? Damn Sy, that is psychotic.”

“Yes it is. If there's a hell I got a lake of fire down there with my name on it, but that’s not why,” Sy cut him off, “cause my dad was working late I always had to wait an hour in school to get picked up. Well, while waiting I’d wander around, play soccer alone. Whatever. Then one day I heard a girl shouting, then I saw Jan, remember Jan Rowan?”

“Yea. Reserved, left school early.”

Sy nodded, and continued with his story. “Jan ran across the soccer field, past me, in tears. Mackenzie was back there, shouting obscenities at her. Anyway, I didn’t think much of it, was couple fight maybe… then it happened again, different place, different girl.”

“He was dating Meli Frost after that,” Orion said “did he…?”

Sy nodded. “Yea, the third time I saw it all well enough, with Truan Nguyen, and he saw me that time...”

“Shit.” Orion said. “Okay, it’s horrible, and he indeed does suck, but like, does that kind of behavior really merit death?”

“I’d say it does. You don’t recover from people doing shit like that to you. Jan left school, as you said. Meli's on meds, and Truan killed herself. Then I saw him hovering around Miles.”

Orion knew that Sy cared for Miles, because unlike most people back then, she treated him fair. Orion suspected he'd had a crush on her at the time. “Fuck. I didn’t know that.” Orion was devastated.

“I found out a few years into Circa. Had he been alive, I would have killed him all over again.”

“Please don't say things like that." Orion said. He then looked at Sy with new eyes, what he did was wrong, but that he'd been trying to protect someone made the whole story easier to digest. “Thanks for telling me. Token might want to hear this too you know...”

Sy shook his head, ”naw, he's too invested in his hatred of me."

“I'm happy you're talking, but I still don’t approve of what you did," he paused then, "did you come back here to hurt my brother?"

Sy did not know where to begin. "No." he said, simply, avoiding talking about Nemerald for the time being. "I just had to leave real fast, it's complicated." he said. "I promise I won't hurt Token, not while I live here anyway. Besides, he's a lot bigger than he used to be. He's a fucking tower now."

Orion laughed at that, "a chonky tower, yea."

Sy nodded, he looked deep in thought and then suddenly asked him about his mom.

"Your mom denied the whole thing you know, refused to believe you did it. People didn't like her for it." Orion wasn't sure he should keep going but Sy asked him another question. "She's alive?"

"Yea, she moved though and I couldn't tell you where. Old house is still there, she couldn't sell it."

Sy felt like he robbed his mum of a good life. "She would have been happier if she hated me." 

Orion gave him a light shove. "She's your mum, she could never hate you."

"That's bullshit, of course she can," Sy said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



"Ever heard of boxer's madness?"

"No," Sy admitted.

"Well, nowadays they call it CTE. It's a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated blows to the head. Our dad's has had his senses obliterated by boxing. He's been taking punches all his life, ever since he was a kid. He was punched in the head 4,000 times by the time he was 13. Doesn't take a genius to know that’s not good for the brain. He's in private care now by the way. He forgets things, has these violent outbursts, can't speak or think well, which you know, makes me think he may have been suffering from early stage of CTE back then too..." Orion explained.

"Oh fuck that, he was well aware of what he did, just like Mackenzie was aware of the fucked up things he did, and even then, the result is the same isn't it? People got hurt." Sy said.

"You're right. But it's tough. I support and defend Token, but I also feel for my dad because of his disease," Orion said. "I hate him for what he did, but also, I wonder if he really meant to do that to him. Like, what if he was imcapable of controlling his actions." He saw the look on Sy's face, "bear with me here," he said, seeing his face warp, ready to retaliate, "Token doesn't know I do this, but I've been researching this a ton. I read of Adam Phelps, a former NFL player that had unusually severe stage 2 CTE. A good guy, happy... well, he did not seem bothered by much, maybe a fatalist like you who the fuck knows. He had a family, friends, money. He fatally shot six people before taking his own life. That was only diagnosed after his death though. His pathology was different, in that it was unusually severe in both frontal lobes." Saying this Orion put two of his fingers to his own head.

Orion took a long pause. He then grabbed his grinder, a small, stout, black cylinder. "What if Token's suffering the same, like... right now? He's got some symptoms, but I mean, it could be a number of things." He removed the lid of a small box, and reached for some cannabis buds. He broke bits off with his fingers, and added it to the edge of the grinder. "I've been counting. On average he gets around 7 shots in the head per round." 

"That's the Token I know," Sy said with a smirk.

Orion was grinding up the buds, the smell rose out of the small container. Before opening it, he tapped it on the ground a few times and removed the lid and transferred it onto a sheet of rolling paper. "John Levan, a local fighter, suffered a serious brain injury after a fight for the lightweight world title last year. He left the ring under his own power, but then he started dragging his leg, and then he collapsed in the dressing room," he spent some time distributing the cannabis around, to distribute it evenly, "he was unconscious for an hour," he pinched the paper between his fingertips and slowly rolled it back and forth to pack the cannabis down, "then he was transported to a hospital and put in a medically induced coma on life support. He died two days later," Orion paused for effect, "he was 29." 

"And Token's 26," Sy said.

Orion nodded, he tucked the paper into a roll, licked the glued edge of the paper and rolled an end down to hold it in place, "and like my dad, he's been getting head shots since he was 12." He worked his way down the rest of the joint, tucking and sealing the joint as he went. Then he pushed a pen through the end of the joint to pack it down further.

"Christ, this is taking forever," Sy said, eyeing the joint.

"That's what you got to to if you want a good burn," Orion said, he then lit the end and inhaled. He held the smoke in his lungs for a while, and then passed it to Sy, exhaling, smoking escaping from his mouth.

"Who's got time for perfection," Sy inhaled, keeping it in his lungs a long while to, absorbing more of the cannabinoids and terpenes into his bloodstream. "Oh fuck," he said aloud, leaning back into the couch.

Orion laughed, grabbing the joint back. "Told you, it's good. It's good because I don't cheap out, and I don't rush either," after sampling it again, he passed it back to Sy.

"Can't believe I'm gonna say this but, I'm done" Sy said, refusing it.

"So what's your plan anyway? Our couch is yours for now, but like... long term. What are you going to do?"

Sy thought about it for a moment, then smirked, "smoke, drink, eat and sleep, rinse and repeat. That's my long term plan."

"I don't have any long term plans either," Orion breathed. "I could get you a job at the bar I'm working at."

"Fuck no," Sy said.

"We'll have to change your name though," Orion thought for a moment, "Chips!"

"That is a shit name," Sy said.

"No, no... I mean chips, as if, we've got chips!" Orion stretched over the side of the couch and when he sat back down again, he held a bag of vinegar kettle chips. He opened the bag and offered Sy some.

"Call me Tim in public, Sy in private."

Orion smirked. Tim was the name of his father, now dead. Sy had always preferred using his mother Harlow's surname, Cross, but his birth certificate read Sy Keon-Cross, back then Montore families appended both family names.

"We should dye your hair," Orion said, excited at the idea. "OH! You'd look smokin' hot as a blonde." Seeing the look on Sy's face Orion thought it prudent to suggest something else. "I'll cut your hair. Nothing crazy, I promise. I've got some clothes for you too."

Sy eyed Orion's teal crop top and black leggings. "No one would ever suspect me if I wore that shit, but I don't think I have in me Rye." he said. 

Orion laughed. "I'll dig up some normie clothes for you, don't worry."

"You'd better." Sy agreed, taking the joint from Orion's hands again, "and as for the hair, don't fuck it up."

CALEB AND JAK COME CALLING

One rainy morning, leaving Mari's appartent for a morning run, he ran into Caleb. The girl stood in front of him, eyeing him over, waiting for a reaction.

"You have Sy with you," she said. "What are you waiting for?"

Token looked at her from under his large hood, rain trickling down on the ground around them.

"What? Did you become friends again suddenly?" Caleb asked him.

"Course not..." Token replied bitterly, "It's just that he's gonna kill him isn't he?"

Caleb looked at him, although her eyes weren't visible through her shades. Her lips curved up into a bit of a smile. "What's it to you?"

"I don't know if i want to be part of this...."

Caleb laughed. "You don't have a choice Malvado"

Token felt sick, just as he'd felt when he learned Sy was back. He looked down at the ground...silently.

"Tomorrow." Caleb said

"Can't you guys get him…?" he whispered, in a near begging tone.

Caleb grinned, "Yes, but Nemerald believes it's something you should do. Good day Malvado."

Token stared at them as they disappeared behind a veil of rain. He didn't have a choice. If he didn't bring Sy, his life would once again be ruined. He felt stressed out, more than ever. He could barely eat or sleep.

STAYING WITH THE MALVADOS

This whole time Token was trying to figure out how he was going to get Sy back to Circa. The only way he knew how was through the clinic, but getting him there would be difficult. Sy would have to be unconscious, he knew Orion would never accept it either. That was perhaps the safest way to do it, and Orion wouldn't blame him. He could just say Sy decided to return to Circa, because he was unhappy here in this world. He could imagine that happening, then he would finally be rid of him.

As kids, they used to be able to travel there without having to use a portal, but Token only ever did it with Sy, never alone, and now it had been so long that he couldn't remember how to do it. He looked at his hands, and began touching his thumb to the tops of his phalanges. He did this in a specific order, while muttering some words under his breath. He couldn't remember the exact sequence. "Fuck," he cursed.

Token wasn't sure if he would be able to fake being nice to him until then, Sy would see right through it.

He fought with this thought for a while, then he realized that he needed to stick with what he was good at. Brute force.

One evening Token returned to the apartment, he hadn't been there in days. He arrived to find Sy reading a book on the balcony and Orion rolling up a joint. "The fuck is he doing out there? People could see him."

Orion shrugged it off. "Pft, he's been out there all week, no one cares," Orion eyed Sy on the balcony for a moment, "I changed his hair, better clothes." Sy was wearing an outfit from Orion's closet, a pair of fitted lightgrey jeans, and a black t-shirt with a Russian band logo in the back, reading Медали. Both were near the same height, and had a similar waist size. He had black sneakers with white soles, and on the back of his chair hung a heavy greenish grey (feldgrau) stonewashed canvas jacket, two items Orion had found for him at the thrift store. Sy's hair was short on the sides and back, longer at the top. The shorter hair was dyed a dark red color, while the top was still black. Sy was real high at the time and didn't care then. "He wanted to hit me the next day, like real bad. I think he likes the red though, he won't say but I know he does. Like, as if he couldn't tell I was bleaching his hair y'know?"

Sy was less scruffy, he had a muted, clean appearance that would not draw attention. Token tried to calm himself down, he went to take a seat on the couch. "You're going back to work tomorrow right?" he asked his brother. 

Orion had taken a week off work, so he would have time to take care of Sy. Orion nodded, "yeaaa, I did tell them I was going to come in Monday, but I might extend my sabbatical. I hardly ever take time off, if they're upset well, I'm good for money right now, and I can find some other job later when I run out."

"He can take care of himself," Token said.

"You've got Mari, he's got no one," Orion explained. "Everyone needs someone."

Orion probably wouldn't believe he would volunteer to watch Sy. This tactic wouldn't work, he needed a new plan.

About a week later, Token found his window. Their mother, Petra, was supposed to come to town to visit. Orion groaned, "She's probably mad because I blew her off the last time she was here." There was no getting out of it, Petra was coming over and they needed to get Sy out. Petra knew Sy, there was a chance she would recognize him. Orion didn't know what to do, he couldn't trust anyone with Sy, and he wasn't sure if he wanted Token to help. At this point though, he didn't have a choice, besides he didn't believe Token would try anything else. He arranged for Token to take Sy with him for a few hours the day of Petra's visit. Token couldn't have orchestrated a better opportunity himself. 

That morning they snuck Sy out of the building and into Token's car. "You'll call me if anything happens right?" Orion said to his brother. "Yes yes..." Token said, dismissively. 

Orion gave him a shove, "I'm serious, you need to keep him safe." 

Token didn't like when Orion was being an adult, it made him feel bad about what he was planning to do. "I will," he reassured him. He was once again amazed at how easy he could lie to people, it was second nature. Lying to Orion didn't feel great though. Orion smiled, "thanks."

Token and Sy drove off. It was an awkward car ride, Token said nothing and Sy didn't try speak either. They drove for a long time, buildings became trees, sidewalks disappeared entirely. "I gatta take a piss," Sy said finally, after an hour of silence. 

Token pulled over, he watched Sy work his way towards the nearest tree. He didn't know why he thought he had to pee on a tree at all, but it just felt right. 

Token got out of the car and walked right over, thankfully Sy was done by the time he arrived. "What the fuck!" Sy said before Token shoved him onto the ground. Sy barely had time to tie his belt, "I get it, we're not friends. But you could at least let me take a piss in peace." 

Token gave a great big kick in his gut, Sy was gasping for air. Token walked around him. "I'm taking you back to Kozi."

Sy couldn't speak, he just focused on breathing for now. He shook his head and tried to get away but Token just grabbed his shirt collar. "Let's go," Sy's hands were flat in the dirt, he curled his fingers and grabbed fistfuls of dirt and threw it up into Token's face. He then made a run for the car, Token's car was the only option for a quick getaway.

Token chased after him. Sy was halfway into the car, but Token was fast, he pulled him away from the door and took a swing at him. Sy was able to dodge that. "I'll die if I go back," he managed to say. 

"You'll die if you stay here too," he yelled back angrily, taking another swing. Token's fist came inches from his head, Sy was determined to avoid any contact with his fists since that last time they fought.

"Why do you want to live?!" Token shouted suddenly, his voice echoing throughout the forest and empty road.

Sy stared at him, silent at first. He didn't know the answer to that question. "Why do you?" He asked him. His hands were full of dirt, his knees too, his pants were untied still, barely hanging around his skinny waist.

"I can't stand you," Token said.

"Notice how non-threatening I've been this last week? You've been throwing all the punches, Token." Sy said, throwing up his hands to show how he wasn’t going to return his violence, he had promised his brother he wouldn't.

Token rushed towards him again and grabbed the front of his shirt. "I don't like myself when you're around. You bring out the worse in me."

Sy laughed, "I bring out the real you, and the real you is DARK as FUCK. You spend all your time performing for others, and you're tired Pen, I can tell, and you're angry because I know your secret. C'mon, drop the act and be free."

Token punched Sy in the gut, harder than before. He watched him keel over, gasping for air. Then, Token shifted his weight to his rear leg, he stepped his rear heel down and then threw a left hook forward. His fist was like a finely crafted blade, cutting the air, until it met with Sy's jaw. The resulting head snap caused Sy's brain to slam on the inside of his skull, knocking him right out. Sy fell limp, unsconcious. Token proceeded to tie his arms at his back, his also taped the fingers on each hand together, so he couldn't transport himself away, and dragged him over to the car, and then threw him in belly first before tying his ankles together. Deep down he hoped he'd hit him so hard he would never wake up. But Sy awoke a second after that, but he was stuck and couldn't move. His face had already begun to swell then.

He then proceeded to drive over to Nemerald's lab, their next stop was the portal. It wasn't far, just 20 minutes away. He looked at his phone to see that he had 10 unread messages... he could only see the first 4 in the preview.

"Fyi, Troy's coming over later :eggplant: :devilface:" 
"fml, mom is so annoying :weary:"
"Is Sy okay?" 
"Please don't fight :sadface:"

He didn't read the rest, he felt guilty enough already. "Don't puss out," Token said to himself. He shut his phone off, and threw it in the glove compartment, determined to pretend it didn't exist.

TAKING SY OUT

Token drove to the lab, untied Sy's legs and yanked him out of the car, then pushed him along towards the entrance. Token entered with the key card Nemerald had provided and then through the white door. Of course, Sy recognized the space, but he thought it funny to have to come through here physically.

"You don't remember how to do it," Sy said, amusedly, "Rye was right, your brain IS turning into compote."

Token shook him, tightening his grip on the back of his shirt, "shut UP."

Together walked past sets of brooms and buckets and on into the dark tunnel. He pulled Sy around for what felt like ages, they arrived on the other side. But for some reason, they hadn't walked in to Nemerald's mountain hideout like normal. They were outside. It was like the tunnel had been re-routed. Token released Sy for a second, and wandered back into the tunnel, and saw that the end was close off. "What the hell." The gap behind them closed after they entered. Token made his way back outside, his eyes locking on Nemerald's mountain in the distance.

Sy stared around, laughing. “Not where you were expecting?” He thought of running away then, but knew he didn't have a chance out here, his hands were tied and he had no friends.

Token notice Sy's face didn't look as fucked up as it should have been. Sy's face was immaculate, but he didn't have time to think about it too much because a tall figure formed behind him, grabbing the back of his neck and lifting him off the ground. Token was tall, but this figure was much taller, and stronger. "No wait!" Token yelled. "I work for Nemerald!" he shouted at him, thinking he was one of Nemerald's goons.

Token didn't know better, but that was probably the worse thing for him to say. Vincent looked at Sy with bound hands. "Did you bring him back here for a reward of some kind?" he asked Token.

Token looked terrified, "I-uh, nononono I had to! I had to! I was made to!"

"Here's what's going to happen," Vincent began, "Nemerald will undoubtedly come to collect his prize, so we will wait."
 Vincent glanced over at Sy then. "So, you want this guy dead or what?" 

Token looked like he was about to vomit. His life was in Sy's hands.

"Yea. He punched me in the head, so go on and yank his head off," Sy said, looking Token in the eyes. Vincent's hand gripped Token's head then. Token's body stiffened, "HOLY SHIT! NO!" he yelled, but then Sy laughed and lifted a hand, gesturing for Vincent to stop. "Kidding, he can keep his head." He neared Token then, and pat him on the chest, "remember this kindness, kay shit stain?"

THE FIGHT

Nemerald was very aware that Token had returned to Circa with Sy, and that both were being detained by Vincent and Seir. What he didn't understand though was how his passage from the real world had led them out elsewhere in Circa. This had never happened before. He suspected it to be the handiwork of Azi.

Finally, he decided on sending a messenger.

Jak made his way over to where they were, for a second it looked like Vincent was going to attack but then stopped. Sy looked at him, "why not kill him?" 

Vincent spat. "A clone, destroy him and there will be more. Let's just see what he has to say."

"Merci de ne pas me faire de mal," Jak said, bowing lightly, "je suis ici pour négocier."

Vincent frowned, "I don't speak whatever language that is... I'll gladly give you these humans," he said, lifting Token off the ground again by his arm and pointing over to Sy. "In return, leave the mountain."

Jak smirked, switching to English, "this will not be possible."

Vincent grunted, "then you're not getting anything."

Jak smirked. He began to draw shapes in the air, Vincent threw Token on the ground and retaliated, but their movements were so quick that it was hard for human eyes to follow. The air around them became thick, electric. Sy saw the hair on his arms rise, glanced at Token he noticed his hair was pointing skyward. The grass at their feet fizzed and burned, turning to ash on the ground. Sy was entranced, it was like watching gods battle. Then suddenly Sy saw an arm fly off, a big arm. "Shit." Sy said, recognizing it to belong to Vincent. He got up and was going to run but Token grabbed him. Sy's hands were still bound so he was easy enough to handle. 

Token began to drag Sy back toward the mountain, but it was not easy. Sy was fighting back hard this time Then suddenly they heard a loud scream, and out of a giant cloud of dust, the victor came out. Jak was battered, but not beaten. Vincent was gone. Jak caught up with Token and grabbed Sy from him. "Don't try anything," Jak told him. Token, Sy and Jack walked next to each other, heading over to Nemerald's lab.

"I hit you damn hard," Token said to him, as they walked.

"Stop boasting," Sy said.

"How are you okay? You don't have a fucking mark on you," Token said, feeling crazy, suddenly. He had imagined what happened? He wondered if his brain was really going to shit, to the point where he was hallucinating fights. "I hit you, I did... didn't I?"

Sy bore a self-satisfied expression. Jak shushed them then, as they neared the mountain.

Jak arrived in front of the door to Nemerald's lab, the door that had intrigued them all of these years ago. It opened. Token entered, Sy didn't. Jak walked him inside, and into the main lab. Token was relieved, he felt safe here. Sy on the other hand, his eyes darted around... searching for Nemerald. Suddenly Nemerald came walking into the room and with a wave of his hand he locked Sy into place, little bolts of electricity jumped from Sy's body as it tensed up. Sy couldn't move a muscle. With another wave of his hand, Nemerald forced him to kneel on the ground.

Nemerald's throat was terribly bruised from Sy's attack, he still had black, bumpy stains on his skin, like his skin had begun to rot. His skin was discolored all the way down to his shoulders. Nemerald's face was pale, like all of the blood had gone from his head. "What should I do with you," he asked himself.

The skin on his hands and arms blackened. Black tar pushed out of his mouth. Token was terrified, he found a wall and kept his back to it. What was wrong with Sy?! Yess was still inside him, and was fighting hard. Jak had to help restrain him on the ground.

Nemerald looked over at Jak. Jak appeared confused too, staring at the far end of the room where they had previously locked Yess away, and yet he was still in Sy. Jak whispered in Eidoluk, to try and subdue Yess further. For now it seemed to work, the black receded. 

Sy laughed, "I thought he'd left me already," he realized then that this is why he was healing so fast. "How is he both over there in that...diamond thing, and in me still. Makes no fucking sense."

Jak knelt beside him then, speaking in a double voice. One voice continued speaking in Eidoluk, reciting incancations, while the other addressed Yess directly. "Every part of Yess, is Yess," Jak said. "Les deux moities sont Yess. Mais celle si a decider de ne pas quitter ton corps."

Sy frowned, “It won't leave my body? Why the hell not?” 

Jak shrugged, “Il n'a pas dit.” 

“Well, ask again!” Sy cried. 

“He’s inside you, you ask him. Meilleure réception...” Jak winked.

Sy tried to focus for a second, to see if he could contact Yess. There was a voice in there, but it was faint. “I can’t hear shit. Fuck it, I'll talk to other one.” but then realized he still couldn't move a muscle.

Nemerald approached him then, inspecting his eyes, limbs, heart rate. Then without warning, he grabbed his hand, he pricked him with a device and he took a blood sample and went to analyze it. “Um. Seems like Yess likes it there, so much that he's started changing your physiology,” he released Sy. "Congratulations, you are now host to a demon."

Sy looked confused for a second, but then just started to laugh. “Shit. I joked about not being entirely human, but now it’s real real.” Then laughter turned to panic, and Sy vomited at Nemerald’s feet.

Nemerald looked at Sy like he did with his experiments. "Interesting. But not interesting enough."

Then Jak grabbed a hold of him, he placed a hand on his chest and spoke rapidly. Sy felt a pressure in his chest, then a great wave of pain, like something inside was trying to get out, but then the pain began to lessen, and then nothing. "The fuck..." Sy said, panting. 

Jak removed his hand. "Après toutes ses gentillesses, tu conspires avec des démons contre Nemerald. Tu mérites tout ce qui t'arrive." 

Sy looked at Jak, "what can I say, I'm a flip-flopper."

"Tu es un opportuniste, un traître." Jak corrected, and dragged him right off, and tossed him inside a room, the room was dark and seemed to have swallowed Sy whole. Then, the door was locked behind him.

Nemerald sighed, and turned to Jak. "Sy attacked me with Yess inside of him, would you say he too was responsible for this attack?”

Yes,” Jak answered promptly, "Vincent and he worked up a deal, I saw it in his heart. Sy had no issue crossing you."

“Right..." Nemerald said, he looked disappointed. "How are you?" he asked, inspected Jak's body suddenly, the fight with Vincent had left some marks. "Any pain?"

"Ca va passer," Jak said, "Si ca t'dérange pas, j'vais aller m'étendre."

"Of course, go." Nemerald said, rubbing his shoulder. "Bon travail," he said, as he watched him walk away. Jak nodded, disappearing into his quarters to rest.

Token sat in a chair. "I thought you sent out clones..." he asked.

"I don't make them anymore. Relying on clones made us both reckless. Jak is a better fighter if he knows he can be killed, and I only ever send him out if absolutely necessary," Nemerald said, sitting on a chair across him, eager to rest too. His throat was sore from speaking. He was healing but wasn't 100% yet. "Jak risked his life out there for you, wouldnt have happened if you had arrived directly here in the clinic with Sy like I asked you to.”

Token nodded nervously, "I don't know how what happened, I swear. The route changed."

"Maybe a part of you wasn't ready to give him up." Nemerald knew it wasn't his fault, really, but he felt that if he made Token feel like it was that he could have further control over him. "We'll talk about that later. For now, we can talk about Sy."

"What's the black room?" Token asked.

"It is a sensory deprivation room, relaxing, and conducive to meditation. At least, it is for me, but for Sy it is solitary confinement. Punishment. If she spends enough time in it the black room will wage war on his mind," Nemerald explained.

"Right. How long will you leave him there?"
 
Nemerald smirked, he'd been waiting to be asked that. "I'll let you decide how long. If you want him to stay there forever that's fine too. It's all up to you," he said, turning his back to him, and going to sit at his computer. He began to work, leaving Token with this task. Token wasn't sure what to do, he felt Sy deserved the punishment, but he didn't like the idea that he had to decide how long. He kept staring at his watch nervously, wondering how long was enough. He kept thinking of Orion, and how he would have pulled him out the instant Nemerald had mentioned he could. Token was paralyzed, unable to decide. He couldn't focus on anything else. A few minutes into it he hesitantly stood up, and walked over to the black room. He stood in front of it, he even pressed his ear up against it to see if he could hear anything. Complete silence. Maybe Sy was okay? Token hated the idea that he was worried about him. He kept pacing around the door, angry at himself for feeling so terrible about keeping him locked in there.

"Is Sy a prisoner here now?" he asked Nemerald. 

Nemerald did not turn to face him. "Yes," he said, returning to his work. 

"What does it mean? He can't leave? What happened anyway?" Token insisted. 

"Sy made a choice. He made an attempt on my life, even after I accepted him here. I gave him purpose, fed and housed him," Nemerald answered, "had he come to me with this deal, I could have protected him." 

Token didn't know he had tried to kill Nemerald, he couldn't understand what pushed Sy to do this. "What are you going to do with him?" 

Nemerald spun round in this chair and faced him. "Why? You want to take him home?" He asked, taking his glasses off and staring at him. 

"No," Token said, "I'll um, I'll be seeing you", with those words he left Circa through Nemerald's clinic. There was nothing he could for Sy, like Nemerald had said he made his choice. What a choice that was too, what possessed him to try and murder someone who controls the gate to Circa?

He returned home and faced his brother "I left you a ton of messages," Orion said, "where have you been? Where's Sy?" 

Token explained that he was back in Circa and that he shouldn't try and get him, he told him what happened and the reason he had left. 

Orion would hear none of it. "Nemo is a shifty guy, Sy probably had reasons," he said, he was already planning in his head what he was going to try and do to get him back. 

Token knew his brother would act like this, he believes everyone is worth saving. "Don't cross Nemerald" he told him, "Just don't. He’ll hurt you and I… I don’t want that. Promise me you won’t go."

Orion looked sad and mad, brows furrowed. “You forced him back. He didn’t want to go back.” 

"Sy tried to kill him, okay? That's why he left Circa, he was running away. Attacking Nemerald was a choice he made,  just like how he chose to hurt Mackenzie back then. He's a fucking psychopath." Token explained.

"I don't understand, why did he make you do it? It has nothing to do with you!" Orion said, visibly upset.

“I had no choice!” Token yelled back, sick of being questioned.  

Orion became angry then. “WHY though?! I don't know what he's done for you because you won't tell me, but whatever it is... he shouldn't have this power over you, he can't be allowed to manipulate you like this. He’ll never be done with you you know, he’ll have you do more horrible things and you’ll keep saying you have no choice as if saying that makes it okay! It doesn’t absolve you of anything. You’re going to help me get him back Token.” With this he left the room. 

“Don’t be stupid Orion!” Token snapped back, then he went to grab a cup of coffee in the kitchen, but he couldn't enjoy it, he couldn't enjoy himself. "FUCK!" he yelled, throwing the cup against the far wall in the kitchen. The cup shattered into a million pieces, the black coffee staining the wall, and floor. The brown liquid left long streaks on the wall. Token cursed aloud again and went to sit down on a chair next to the kitchen table, with his head in his hands.

<!-- <h3>Kima</h3>

Kima is lying down in bed, staring at the ceiling. Something in the corner of the room suddenly gets her attention, she looks over and sees a distinctive figure standing in there. Her hand moves from under the covers and over to a lamp on her desk. She flicks on the light and whatever was there, if anything at all, is now gone. Kima lets out a deep sigh, she is about to turn out the light but then doesn't. She goes to sleep with the light on, knowing it'll keep the monsters at bay.

"I've been having nightmares and have been seeing things since i was a little girl. I've tried everything, but it always feels like something is hiding in every dark corner. I have yet to see what it is, it always vanishes with light. Maybe it's not time for me to see just yet, but i'm growing impatient'85 and it's getting harder to explain. I just need to know i'm not crazy"

Kim is at work at her mom’s cafe, the Sotto Voce, playing with the ring on her finger, the ring she has been wearing for the past few years now. She is distracted, staring ahead at no one, and nothing in particular. Her mind wanders often.

Valence, her co-worker and friend, poked Kim in the side. “He’s hot isn’t he?” she said.

Kim snapped out of her reverie then. “What? Who?”

“The guy at the bus stop, you’ve been staring for the past 5 minutes Kim.”

Kim had not realized that her gaze had been set in his general direction, it really did appear as if she had been watching him. Now her eyes focused on the guy at the bus stop. She smiled, “yea, he’s cute. Bit odd though.” Now that her eyes had found him, she could not stop taking in his features. He had silvery blue hair, his skin was pale and he wore a set of blue robes. 

“3 buses have gone by, and he hasn’t boarded any.” Valence said. “Strange no? Strange considering only 3 buses go by here. Maybe he’s waiting for a friend?”

“He's a half-demon,” Kim said with a smile. He looked at every passing person, he seemed entranced with every one and every thing. A bird landed on the ground near him and he bent forward, bringing his hand near it. The bird hopped into his hand and made a few short hops up his arm until it set on his shoulder. Kim laughed then, “he’s a disney prince Val, look at that!”

Valence was making a coffee for a customer, but stopped to look. She laughed as another bird came to land on his other shoulder. “You should invite him in,” she said grinning deviously.

“Pft yea…” she guffawed, but then smirked, laughed and removed her apron. “I’ll take my break now.”

“If you're lucky he'll burst into song, he'll take you in his arms and you'll walk off into the sunset,” Valence said, frothing up some foam.

Kim pretended to gag, "like I want that." She prepared two cups of coffee and walked out towards the bus stop bench. When she neared him, the two birds flew away. The disney prince looked over at her, his grey eyes locked onto her. He had cast his line, and Kim was hooked, line and sinker. “You like coffee?” she asked him. 

His eyes lingered on her, he did not look at the cup she was offering him. "Yes” he said, his nostrils flaring as he took in the smell, all the while, his gaze was set on her. "But not that coffee."

“So bad you can smell it huh? she said, brushing her hair behind her ear, intimidated by his constant, intense stare. “It's actually not half bad, but I've got simple tastes.” she said, giving it to him anyway, hoping to free herself of his hold. It worked. His eyes moved to look at the cup, and now he only had eyes for the brown, hot liquid. 

“Thank you.” he said, "I won't drink it, but thank you."

Kim laughed. “I work at the cafe there," he said. “Thought you could use some company. You’ve been sitting there alone a long while.” Kim drank her own cup.

“Oh, yes. Maybe. I’m not sure.” he said, setting the coffee down beside him. 

“What’s your name?”

“Seir.” he said, his eyes returning to her now.

“I’m Kim,” she said, extending out her hand.

Instead of taking her hand, his fingers wrapped around her forearm. 

She laughed, and her fingers coiled around his forearm too. His skin felt cold, almost artificial. 

“Why are you laughing?” he asked, grinning. His pearly whites came into view, he had unusually sharp canines, and his teeth were perfect, bright and straight. 

“Oh nothing. You don’t respond like others do, but I like that. You’re different.”

“And different is good?”

Kim nodded, “well, I like it.” her cheeks reddened then. “Tomorrow my friend and I are going to Inferno, you know it?”

The word Inferno resounded in his head. “Yes” he said. Inferno was the place Nemerald had instructed him to go. 

“You wanna come?”

Seir nodded, “I’d like that.” He liked how straightforward she was. “You always approach strangers like this?”

“Only cute ones,” Kim said with a wink. 

Seir’s fingers traced down her forearm, wrist, but then lingered on her hand. Kim had started the courtship, and he was ready to dance. “I’ll meet you there.” he said, handing her the empty cup of coffee.

Kim nodded. She stood up taking his cup, “don’t bother waiting outside or anything like that, just be near and around the bar. Have a drink, enjoy yourself, and I’ll find you.” With this, she left and returned to the cafe. Valence was there to meet her, “holy crap Kim, he was eyeing you down like he was ready to eat you. Wild. What happened? What did you say?”

“The prince is meeting me at the ball.” Kim said, with a wide smile.

“Shut UP!” Valence shrieked.

INFERNO

Inferno was a nightclub that was popular because of its reputation as being a gateway to hell. The place was also famous because of its 9 floors going deep underground mimicking the vision of the writer of the divine comedy. The deepest floor was not accessible and was known to be the path to the gateway itself, while the 5 middle floors were either lounge areas, dances floors, bar section ect. Each went along with the themes of the nine levels. The place has 4 sets of elevators for traveling deep underground, as well as a spiral staircase that travels through every level. 
\
level 1- Limbo\
Limbo is the entrance to Inferno, everyone can enter here. Its the coat check area and where the line begins.\

\
\
Upon entering, the girls slipped past level 1 and made their way over to the second level for some drinks. Valence had always heard great things about the bartenders, that they were quite skilled. Valence realized she had forgotten to check her coat, so she waved to her friend telling her she would return momentarily. Kima just went to sit at the bar, where people that came alone usually sat. It wasn't true in her case, but the place was packed and taking a table of 4 for two seemed a little ridiculous.

She began inspecting the menu hanging on the wall, most had pretty odd names but that were quite fitting. She strained her eyes trying to make out what was written up there, she then rolled her eyes when noticing a menu was just sitting in front of her flat on the table. As her finger traced down the various drinks on the list. another person came and   pointed to a specific drink on the menu '"Le parfum" is actually quite good' the other person said. Kima looked over, only to see a man with blazing red hair with a thin face staring back at her. He was dressed like he'd come strolling out of the 1930's.

Valence arrived them, and took notice of him straight away. He was a half-demon, there were a lot of them around here. “Hey, you wanna buy ME a drink?” she asked. 

He looked over at her, and smirked, his sharp teeth poking from under his lips. Kim hadn’t noticed it before, but he was missing an eye. “Yegon,” he said.

“Valence.”

“What’s your drink?”

“Gin tonic”

He ordered her a drink, and they began to chat. Meanwhile Kim was keeping an eye out for her prince. She smiled when she saw him across the bar. She whistled, waving him over. Seir heard her whistle over the noise of the bar, and moved her way. “So, this is Inferno.” he said, eyeing the room and its decorations.

“Thought you said you’d been here.”

Seir shook his head, “No, but i had heard of it.”

Kim was going to introduce Seir to Valence, but noticed that her and Yegon were already locking lips. “Christ Val,” she muttered. She decided then to take Seir’s arm and to lead him upstairs so they could chat in peace, but Seir’s eyes were set on the dance floor. 

He stopped, bringing her to a halt. “Do you want to dance?”

Kim did not expect that, she smirked. “Yea, why not. Let’s.”

They made their way through the dense crowd and found a clear spot. The music was slow, but rhythmic. He put a hand on the small of her back and lead her into an upbeat waltz. 

“Most guys I know don’t like dancing,” she said.

“Dancing is the purest of expressions. It’s the best way to get to know someone.”

Her cheeks flushed. Kim was smitten.

They continued to dance in silence, taking each other in. She had thought Valence promiscuous for kissing that Yegon guy, but she too ached to get closer to Seir. 

Then the song ended, with a more upbeat tune filling the room. Seir quickened his movements and adapted to the song. Kim had no trouble keeping up with him. Beads of sweat formed at her brow, but Seir’s skin was as cold as ever.

Then she saw Yegon a bit behind her. Valence was there, but was standing far behind him. Yegon was yelling at a tall, blonde androgynous person, wearing all white. 

“You have no place here angel!” he yelled. 

Remi smirked. “We share this earth, whether you like it or not, demon.” they said. 

The music lowered then, their voices boomed in the silence, their voices appeared to be amplified.

“Inferno is not of this earth. If you want to stay you’ll have to fight me.” Yegon said, bearing his teeth.

Remi was expression less, but looked ready to take on this challenge, taking a fighting stance. Yegon lunged forward but Remi moved out of the way. Yegon growled as he turned around, lashing at them. Remi grabbed Ygon’s arm and swung him around and into the crowd. Yegon was back on his feet and continued to charge, throwing his fists around. Remi appeared to be floating, moving around noiselessly, their hair appeared to have their own gravity, animated by some invisible wind. Yegon’s eyes were enflamed, glowing a bright orange. Remi threw Yegon back with an open hand, “ENOUGH” they yelled, just then a spotlight came on and engulfed Yegon. Yegon’s feet were cemented on the ground. “I cant move!” he cried, the soles of his sneakers melting into the floor. He jumped out of his shoes, barefoot, but by then Remi was there and slapped their palm on his chest, hand aglow. Yegon shrieked, annd his skin began to crack and glow, and he burst into a ball of flames… smoke covered him and then he was gone, a pile of ash taking his place. 

“AWWW man, I wanted to make out some more with that guy,” Valence cried. All around laughed.

Kim laughed, "first time I've seen this, i've never been here on saturdays."

Seir was intrigued. He knew there were other hegatas here, but he didn't expect to find some so soon.

Seir took her hand, and began to pull her along, heading upstairs, following Yegon’s scent. 

He arrived upstairs on a balcony. Two guards were posted at the top of the stairs, but when they saw him they paid him no mind. He and Kim were allowed through. Seir then found out why. Dante. 

Dante was there, smoking a cigarette and sitting at a table with both Yegon, and Remi. Dante looked up at him then, but moreso, on the girl at his arm. He looked amused, but said nothing.

Kim looked at Seir, “you know dante?” she said in a whisper.

“No he doesn’t know me, but he knows of me, isn’t that right?” Dante said. 

A girl popped up from the stairs and called out to him. “We need you downstairs.” she said. Dante stood up, walked by Seir but then stopped, putting a hand on his soulder. “Welcome home.” he then left, leaving him along with Yegon and Remi. Both were sitting near each other, with Yegon biting Remi’s neck playfully.  

“Do you do that show a lot?” Kim asked, perplexed.

Yegon flicked his fingers, a small flame appeared on his thumb. Remi eyed her carefully, “it varies from week to week, today Yegon died, sometimes I die."

Yegon snickered, a hand reached into Remi’s shirt to caress their front. 

"Hegatas," Kim said, amazed. Her eyes moved onto seir then, “and you too.”

Yegon nodded, “you’ve just found the freshest specimen, he arrived here yesterday.” he said about Seir.

"Where... from?" Kim asked.

“Middle realm," he said, "And you have been here a while?” Seir asked them.

“Inferno? Me, been 5 years… and Remi 10, right?” Yegon asked Rem. Rem nodded with a sigh. “A terrible bore.”

“Youve been living here that long?”

Yegon nodded, “Yea, you get used to the space after a while.”

Seir was confused. “You’ve been here in Inferno for all that time. Why not go out?”

Rem looked at Seir, feeling sorry for him suddenly. “Oh right, you don’t know. Well, in a way, we’re all housemates now so, welcome.”

Seir felt sick suddenly, he vanished from the spot. Kim shrieked, surprised by it. “Holy shit he just… vanished!”. Then he re-appeared there again, 5 seconds later, eyes wide. “We can’t leave.” He looked furious then… “it was a trap… i… cant leave.” His eyes were locked onto the floor. 

Kim looked at him then, “you mean that you can’t physically leave this place?”

Yegon nodded, “Never ever never.” he said, grinning. “Maybe tomorrow Seir can fight me. Putting on little shows is distracting enough, that and all the pretty humans that come every night.”

Seir frowned. He disappeared again.

“Aaaand there he goes again.” Yegon patted the seat next to him, “sit down.” he told KIm. “You his human?” he said as she sat down.

“I’m my own human, thanks. We just met.” seeing he was inching over she put her hand up. “Not interested Yegon.”

Yegon put on a pouty face, and then snuggled up to Rem again instead.

Kim was sad for Seir, he didn’t look like he wanted to be caged up.

Seir found Dante, appearing in front of him. Dante had been reviewing work schedules for renovation on the building when he came. He looked up at Seir. “Sometimes I feel like being dead is better than having to deal with contractors,” he asked, returning his attention to his documents. 

“What kind of sick arrangement do you have with Nemerald?” he said, through gritted teeth. 

“I’m sorry he lied to you, hope you enjoyed your short vacation in the human realm.”

“I was out there for a day…” Seir said, bitter. “I saw nothing.”

“That’s rough. Nothing I can do. You’re free to roam on all levels here in Inferno. Your quarters are on the upper floor, got a good view of the city from up there. You’ll like it.”

“Nothing you can do?” Seir said. “No way that’s true.”

“I’ve got work, Seir, go enjoy yourself. That girl likes you, I’d go back over there to make sure she comes back.” he said.

Seir lunged forward to grab him, but before he could he sank into the floor, all the way to his shoulders. 

Dante stared down at him, and bent down to meet his head. “My place, my rules. You don’t respect them, and I’ll restrict you further… every misstep will result in you losing access to a level, then you’ll end up in the basement, where it’s dark and where there is nothing and no one.” Dante fixed Seir’s hair, pushing stray hairs from his forehead. “And There’s no way down after that, and no way back to my good side either.”

Seir was so angry his whole body shook. “I won’t stay here forever.” he growled.

“You don’t have to.” Dante said, caressing the side of his face. “I can let you return to Circa, but that’s it. Spend a few days here, and let me know what you decide. Um, you truly are beautiful. My office is officially the first place that you’ve been barred from.” With this, Dante placed a hand atop his head and pushed down “goodbye”. Seir sank down further into the floor and landed in the balcony, with the others. 

Kim stood up when he landed there. “You okay? You uh, came out of the ceiling.”

Yegon laughed, “Dante just banished him from his office. I got banned on the first day too.”

Seir stood up, glanced at the others, then at Kim. “You should leave,” he said.

“Okay, if that's what you want” she said, she knew he needed time to process this. She said she would leave, but in reality she made a promise to herself to come back to see him. 

“Don’t come back… please,” he said.

Kim ignored his last request, she was stubborn and would return anyway. She left them, returning to the bar to find Valence.

Seir went to sit on the couch next to Yegon and Remi, thoroughly depressed. 

Yegon tried snuggling up to him but Seir shoved him back so violently that the whole couch flipped with him. Rem was sitting on another section of couch, and moved away just in time, grabbing a book and starting to read it. Yegon groaned, trapped under the couch.  -->

<h3>Saving Sy</h3>

6 months passed, Token moved in with Mari because Orion never really forgave him for what he did to Sy. He moved out the very next day, and they hadn't spoken since.

Token was more medicated than ever, consumed by what he did to Sy. He always assumed that it would make him happy, but he was more miserable than ever. He pretended to go train during the day, but spent his time in the upstairs condo belonging to his father. He was supposed to sell it off for him, but he hadn't done so yet. In the evenings he went back home to Mari.

One day he lay in bed, feeling high, as high as he'd ever felt... and just then he remembered the sequence. Token lay on his dad's old bed, and mouthed the words, and touched his phalanges... then he felt his body lifting, the world around him disintegrating, and re-building around him. He re-appeared in Circa. He saw himself walk to the mountain, to Nemerald's lab. He saw himself walk to the black room door, and saw himself reach for the handle, and he opened it. He opened it and stepped away, he disintegrated again, and re-appeared at the foot of a tree outside of the gym where he worked out at. He made his way back up to the condo, and slept.

The next day, he woke up, wondering if it was something he had actually done. He couldn't tell. He couldn't remember the sequence anymore. Token stayed in bed, determined not to speak to anyone today.

Then he began to function semi-normally again, he went out, saw friends, hung out outside with Mari, went to run, to work out in the gym. A few months later he found in a championship.

He was fighting John Levan, a local fighter. In the third round Token knocked him out cold. Levan left the ring under his own power, but then he started dragging his leg, and then he collapsed in the dressing room. Token was told the fight was cancelled because the other fighter was unresponsive. He was unconscious for an hour, then he was transported to a hospital. Token went home that night, and told Mari about what had happened. It wasn't uncommon in the boxing world. Two days later, he received a phone call. After the fight Levan was put in a medically induced coma on life support, but then he died early this morning.

Token couldn't breathe. 

Later that night, Mari called Orion. "Token OD'ed, he's fine now," she said, through tears. Orion was working at Bats at the time, he dropped what he was doing, told his boss he had an emergency and went straight to the hospital.

Mari sat in the waiting room with Orion. Mari looked glum, she explained that she had found him in the appartment on the floor, unresponsive. She administered some naxolone, and helped him breathe while waiting for EMS to arrive. She looked thoroughly shaken. Orion had an arm around her, caressing her shoulder. "Drug screens were positive for benzodiazepines and oxycodone... they seem to say he's been taking more than 100 milligrams of oxycodone per day," she said.

Orion sighed. "He takes xanax for panic attacks, I did know he was taking oxycodone to treat chronic pain. He must have taken too much... right? That can happen. It was a mistake."

Mari sighed, she explained what had happened on his last fight. "I don't know. I think the guy's death got to him. Someone at the gym told me he's been staying at Luciano's condo during the day, I thought he was training. Addiction to opioid painkillers is common, heavy users develop a tolerance over time, and when you add benzodiazepines to the mix, they can return to the same euphoric feeling they had the first time they abused opioids." She wiped tears from her eyes. "He's going to have a mental health evaluation tomorrow. Doctor told me he may require psychiatric care, he hasn't been super cooperative so far though..." saying this, she appeared relieved, "I've been trying to get him to go for months. I spoke to him an hour ago about it, and he just... even after all this..."

"He's hard, hard headed," Orion said.

Mari nodded. "Doctor came to see me right after, she also told me that depending on the evaluation that civil commitment is possible, since he's a danger to himself. They're keeping him for 72 hours for evaluation."

Orion held her close.

--------------------------------------------

"How are you feeling?”

"Tired," Token replied, leaning back in his chair.

"You've recently experienced a terrible occurrence, one of your opponents died after your fight. That must be difficult." The doctor said, sitting across from him in a private room.

"Dangers of the sport," Token said, avoiding the doctor's gaze, he appeared exhausted, drained.

"It didn't bother you?"

Token stayed quiet for a moment, re-calling the scene in his head, the moment when his fist hit Levan's head, and when he fell limp on the ground. Then he saw the same scene but with Sy on the side of the road, with his body falling into a black hole. Then he saw Mackenzie's dead body, then saw his dad's fist coming to his own head. 

"It's okay to say that it did, it is not a weakness, it's trauma and it is perfectly normal," she said.

"what bothers me," Token began, "is that it doesn't bother me. That's... that's the problem." His thumb moving across his phalanges, trying to remember the sequence again. This detail was not lost on the doctor. "I ought to feel bad. I hurt people... all the time, and I don't feel anything."

"Your work is consentual, you shouldn't feel guilty."

"I don't feel guilty, I want to hurt them." Saying this, he looked up at her. He'd never said this aloud to anyone before. 

"Why do you think you want to hurt people?"

"Because I'm...sad," he said, "and hurt. I don't want other people to be happy, cause I'm not happy." 

"Has something happened recently, to make you unhappy?"

Token wanted to cry, but it's like his body didn't know how. "So many things, I can't say."

"This is a safe space, nothing you say will get out of this room. But also, you don't have to say if you don't want to."

Token felt so weak then, he couldn't take it anymore. "I did try to kill myself," he began, "if I dont take anything I'm constantly in pain, not because of my work..." Token began to sob then. "I've been fighting since i was 8. My dad started coaching me, he believed in me, and I loved him for it. My mom didn't want this for me, she and my dad were already fighting a lot, but that made it worse. She left him, taking Orion with her. I stayed with my dad. I remember, that first night... he put me to bed, like he usually did...but he hugged me a lot. Eventually the um... the touches became much more." It hurt so much to talk about it, it was causing him physical pain. "I didn't stop him," he said, teary-eyed, "I think I..." he lowered his voice, as if about to say something terrible, forbidden, "... I liked it, maybe... I was a fucking kid, y'know?" He paused to take a breath then. "I can't have sex now, it's impossible."

"You experienced a dopamine rush of inappropriate sexual stimulation and attention during your developmental stages, then you were betrayed. So much so, that became infused with your hard wiring....and that is now part of who you are."

"It happened a few other times," Token continued, "but he was trying to ramp things up and when I said no, he got real mad. He continued coaching me after that, but his behavior toward me was super different. He was more aggressive, meaner... at 13 got harder training, I got good," he paused. "My dad was obsessed with my performance, had to know where I was at all times. Was super controlling." He put his head in his hands. "fucking asshole..." he said, sobbing quietly. "When I was 15 I became Montore's number one light flyweight boxer for my age. Wasn't allowed to go out, to see anyone. One night I snuck out to see friends after school. When I got back home he confronted me about it, we argued, he hit me. That night I took a bottle of paracetamol and two bottles of sleeping tablets altogether, spent 2 and a half days in a private clinic, had to stop school for a whole month. I tried to kill myself 4 times that year. My dad hid it all, told no one. I was put under a... secret conservatorship. When I was 17 I got real high, put my left hand in a trash compactor while at the gym. I removed the guard. I almost bled to death that day. I felt all the bones in my hand breaking,” Token recalled. “My hand was hanging off my wrist by strings of skin and tendon," he said. "My dad found me," Token laughed aloud, "He's never far. He shut off the machine. The look on his face that day... I swear, he looked like he wanted to shove the rest of me in there. Yet another accident he had to cover up... I was pleased as punch. In my mind, that was the end of his control over me. I liked boxing, a lot, but I was willing to let that go for a chance at happiness. Surely, he would let go of me then... I couldn't fight anymore."

The doctor looked at his arm. "It was re-attached."

Token laughed, raising his left arm and wiggling his fingers. "No. Arm was so mangled it couldn't be re-attached. That had been my goal, but my dad found a way, yet again. This is a high-tech prosthetic, courtesy of my protector." He reached forward for the doctor's name tag with a pin, the doctor tried to stop him but he drove the pin through his hand, there was no blood. He took it out and returned the pin, "i feel nothing," he said, showing her his hand. "They put me on opioids and anti-depressants then, helped keep me stable. Had intense behavioral therapy. Went back to school, fought again... felt great. Had a brief relapse when my friend murdered someone in front of me, then I left school again and started fighting full-time. Recently my friend came out of hiding, feels like I betrayed him... and in a way, I did. I was trying to be good back then, and he believed I shouldn't try. He said that trying wouldn't make be happier, it wouldn't make me a better person either. I was fucked up, and dark inside, and I had to accept that fact. I think I understand now, what he meant," he paused. "The safest way of not being very miserable is not to expect to be very happy. Happiness is for people who have never suffered."

Token neared his chair to hers then, he looked as calm as he'd ever been in his life. "All of this. This is between you and me... right?" he asked.

The doctor put a hand to Token's shoulder then, "The pain in the world always outweighs the pleasure, yes. Compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is eating the other, the agony of the devoured animal is always far greater than the pleasure of the devourer," she paused, "it's between us, yes, but I'd like you to stay here a while, so we can continue to talk about this. There is no miracle cure, but there are options for you."

"My dad won't want me to stay here."

"We can protect you, but that would mean making others aware of what's happened to you. I will not make that choice for you. Would you like us to help you?"

Token shook his head. "No, if I expose him it will expose me, and I'm not ready for that kind of attention... it might kill me. Talking about it now, it helps though. My friend Sy isn't the best therapist, but he tried to do right by me... in his own... twisted way," he felt a pressure in his chest then, eyeing the doctor. He looked at his prosthetic, and suddenly understood. "It isn't real, because it isn't I can't..." he laughed out loud, "all this time. Shit, i really did imagine it. Sy is still in the black room. I might have killed my only true friend in this world."

----------------

A door opened, light poured into the void. Someone walked near, and helped him up. He walked alongside him, and one other person before settling into what appeared to be an all-white room. His eyes couldn't yet adjust, he closed them.

The following days, his skin became warm again, his eyes adjusted and his hunger returned. He stayed in bed most of the time, unable to think. His brain was like pudding. People were around, getting food into him, and making sure he was warm, and never alone. The whole time he was lying down he felt a heartbeat through someone's skin. For now, he focused on that rhythmic sound. 

He couldn't read people's faces, everything was just colors, and blurs, words were nonsensical, a series of notes describing nothing. 

Eventually, his eyes focused, and he could see a large, furry beast nested beside him. His hand moved to touch it. The beast raised its head then, and called something aloud to someone else.

Kim came running, she sat beside him, putting a hand on his chest, "hey hot stuff."

Sy understood that, but he felt like he was watching the scene from inside a giant robot. These things were happened to someone else, and he was still far, far away. A mere observer, a non-participating entity in the world of the living. 

Orion came over then too, grinning, "welcome back~!"

Someone else was in the room, but they kept their distance. They were too far to make out. Kim helped Sy into a seated position. "don't rush him Rye," she told Orion, seeing as he was coming near to hug him. Kim brushed his hair gently, "you're safe," she said with a soft, reassuring smile.

--------------------------

On the next few days, Sy started doing more and more things, but getting him to talk again was not so easy. Kim continnued to talk to him anyway, so did Orion. Kim read him books at night, aloud, and Orion made food for everyone. Sy ate a little, not as much as he ought to though.

Then one day, his eyes were able to focus on far away things too, and it's then that he recognized the other person in the house. Sy's eyes were fixed on Token. Token had been dreading this, he stayed where he was. Kim and Orion were working, the only ones around were himself and Chelsea. "I can't apparate because of my hand," Token said aloud suddenly, "I realized that the other day. I didn't forget the sequence, how could I? It's what was keeping me sane back then..."

"Who's sane," Sy said aloud then. 

Token hadn't expected him to speak. "Not me," Token said, smirking, "not for a long, long time." He sighed. "I'm sorry, for everything."

"Shit, what reality is this even..." Sy said, closing his eyes.

"I need your help," Token then said.

Sy laughed, he then waved him away, saying nothing more.

Token told Orion about this later, when he returned to Kim's place after work. Currently, Token was in an outpatient program to help him work through his addiction, he was on methadone, and doing better overall. He was staying with Mari still, but came by to Kim's place almost everyday to see Sy. 

"He thinks you're not real," Orion said, smirking, "you're being too un-Token-like."

"Is he gonna be fine though?"

"Yea, he's got a spirit of steel, just got to give him time to acclimate," he said.

Sy did get better over the next few days, but he was quieter, overall. It was hard to tell when he was in the room, his whole personality was muted, subdued. Then one day he got up and went to sit in front of Token, who had been texting Mari at the time.

Token looked up at him. 

"How did you get Kozi to let me leave," Sy said aloud, arms crossed over his chest.

"We didn't ask," Token explained. "We, well... someone helped us open another door. Kozi thinks you're still in there."

"How..." Sy asked, perplexed.

His answer came just then. Kim walked into the house, and with her, was Tuseere, along with a red-haired hegata.

--------------------------------

Tuseere appeared out of place in this house, they were overly well-dressed, overly clean, not a hair out of place. They wore a blue suit, with a white blouse, and black-pointed shoes. They walked over to the kitchen, waving Sy along. Kim and Yegon joined them. Everyone but Yegon took a seat at the table.

"You know who I am," Tuseere said.

Sy nodded, "why help Kozi's dog?" he asked then.

"A favor to a friend," they said. 

Sy glanced at Kim, she had risked a lot helping him. "So you asked them to get me out,"

Kim nodded, "After Token came to see me, cause I had no effing clue where you were. He described the space, and I told Tuseere about it and one thing led to another..."

Tuseere grinned, "you don't need to know details."

"Why's that."

"Plausible deniability." Tuseere answered. "I have a proposition for you,"

"Great"

"Kozi and I used to be good friends," Tuseere began, "we have similar goals. We meet once a year, actually. But he doesn't trust me, well, he doesn't trust anyone anymore. I want him on my side again, but he insists on remaining neutral."

"What the fuck are you talking about, what goals."

"He wants to protect ancients, and hegatas, that's always been his goal. He and Jak guarded the Ayerli'kum, the space between spaces. On one side you've got Gaukum'in, or Circa, as you know it, and on the other Hakum'wi, this place we all now stand. The Hakum'wi pass was guarded by yet another collaborator, he's had many names, back then he was named Azi. Then 100 years ago, Azi and Kozi decided to block the Ayerli'kum pass, effectively trapping Kozi and Jak where they were, and those stranded in Gaukum'in. No one knows why." Tuseere explaining, "as children, you and your friends found another path to Gaukum'in, by way of a transportation spell. Knowing the spell alone, as you know, isn't enough to get someone through. For instance..." Tuseere began to touch their own phalanges, in a specific sequence, "this is it right? Well, I'm still here, it ought to work... but it doesn't. Why do you think that is?"

Sy shrugged, "i don't know."

Tuseere smirked, they leaned forward on the table and placed an open hand near Sy, "give me your arm," they said, "nothing wicked, I promise."

Sy hesitate, but then plopped his arm into Tuseere's cold, pale hand. Tuseere then folded his fingers, so they curled towards Sy, and then tapped his phalange, in a different sequence, they also muttered words under their breath. Then Sy felt ill, and noticed black pigments forming on the skin of the same arm. The black accumulated in the limb above his elbow and pooled there, as if drawn by something. Then Yegon came forward, grabbed a cloth place mat on the table, coiled it around Sy's forearm, just below the elbow joint and then added a buttering knife, and began to twist it, producing a makeshift tourniquet to cut the flow of blood to his lower arm. The black could not leave that area. Tuseere grabbed Sy's other hand then, and repeated the same sequence on that side. Sy didn't expect anything to happen, but then he saw the veins under the skin also change color. The black on his other arm was trying to squeeze past the tourniquet then too. "Shit..." Sy said, "the fuck is going on."

Tuseere placed a finger on the veins of Sy's left arm, "This Is Yess," then he moved to his right arm, another finger resting on a colored vein, "this is... well, I don't know who this is. But they've been there a long, long while, I think. This is who permits you to apparate, the sequence is merely a way to communicate your desire. I can apparate to another place within Gaukum'in, or Hakum'wi, but I can't move between different realms. Whatever is inside you can."

"I can only ever appear at the same spot," Sy explained. "So this thing... ima call it Oss, cause naming shit makes things easier, Oss is also a demon?" Sy said.

"Yes definitely. Although Yess doesn't hide, Oss does and I don't know why. Maybe they're asleep, maybe they don't want to reveal themselves. I am in favor of the dormant theory, because you ought to be able to apparate anywhere, but you are stuck traveling between very specific coordinates. I'd like to try to talk Yess into awakening Oss, somehow, so we can gain more control. That is the first step."

"Token used to be able to do it, not anymore though" Sy said, "does he have that shit in him too? Jak told me that every part of Yess, is Yess... so seems possible that every part of Oss, is Oss."

"If he can do the same, then yes. Though I don't see why it wouldn't work the same way. Anyway, Kozi knows what you can do, it's why he wants to keep you, and it's also why he put Token under a protectorship, because he can use him to bring you back."

"When he dragged me back to Circa, to give me to Kozi, we walked through a pass..." Sy explained. "But then we arrived somewhere new, within Circa... we ought to have arrived in Ayerli'kum."

"That IS... odd," Tuseere said.

"A demon named Vincent found us, hella quick... maybe he was waiting. You think it's possible Yess did that? I mean, their aim was to fuck with Kozi's plans."

"That Token was allowed through the pass... means it was unblocked, for a fraction of a moment. It would appear that I've got to ask Malvado more questions."

"Yea yea, so what's your proposition then..." Sy asked, getting tired of this conversation.

"The second step, assuming we've awoken Oss and that they agree to collaborate, we would be to get you to apparate within the mountain directly, and get you to finish what Vincent started."

"Fuck no," Sy said, "won't work, hasn't worked so far. Why the fuck do you want with the pass? What's it to you?"

"I want control of Ayerli'kum," Tuseere said, "that right belongs to us, not to a human. We ought to control access to our land."

"And you're the one to do it? Yea right, you're doing fucked up shit in this realm. A greedy fucker like you should not get that key." Sy said, standing up.

Tuseere stood up too then, visibly angry. They looked like they were going to hurt him but Kim stepped in, "that's it for today, I think..." she took Tuseere aside to talk to them, they argued back and forth, and then Tuseere left, apparating out of the house. Yegon was still there, eating through the contents of Kim's fridge. "News travels fast," Yegon said, "Kidd's gonna find out, and then you'll have a lot more shit to deal with," he said, smiling broadly. "Seir can protect you," Yegon said.

"Fuck right off," Sy said.

"Kidd hates humans," Yegon said, finished a bag of chips, emptying the crumbs in his mouth before tossing the empty bag on the table. "They won't bother talking to you. Watch your back." With that, Yegon too disapparated. 

Kim and Sy stood alone together in the kitchen. "You want the same things as Tuseere?"

Kim shrugged, "they're not wrong though, no human should hold that key."

"Fuck." He walked off them, and went straight to bed, exhausted.






<!-- 
"Though right now, our guess is that he'll be more interested in Token, for breaking their contract. He won't risk sending Jak, he's all he's got. But I know he's got a contact in Montore, and I want to know who, he must have told you. You worked for him for 5 years." Tuseere said.

"I wasn't his confidant," Sy said. "Just a lowly goon. SO what's your deal anyway, you want to get into Circa?"

"I want to get to Kozi, because I want him on my side."

Sy blinked, "what?"

"It used to be possible to transit in and out of Circa. That's how all the ancients got here, but then 300 years ago, Kozi partnered with a very powerful ancient in Montore, together they blocked they blocked the gate. There is a very strong security on that door, and it stands as long as Kozi and his collaborator decide it doesn't. You were able to bypass this type of transit because you taught Eidoluk magic." -->

<h3></h3>

The next day, Orion and Sy were at Kim's door. Sy was wearing one of Orion's old baseball caps, and wore a pair of thick shades. "Why are we here?" Sy asked.

"Shush, shush!" Orion said.

Kim answered the door moments later, smirking, "Hey O," she then glanced over at Sy, her smirk widening. "Come in."

Sy wasn't sure what to make of her, but he walked inside, following Orion's lead. Orion saw Chelsea in the living room and went to hug her, "hey Chel!" Chelsea put an arm around Orion, "hey hon, how's Galeru?"

"Oh he's good, paranoid, but good. He's pissed at me right now though,"

"A real fuss pot that one," Chelsea then picked up another scent, her eyes locked onto Sy. "Who's this?"

"Sy, this is Chelsea, Chelsea, Sy. He's going to be crashing here for a while, I mentioned him to you yesterday and you said it was fine," Kim explained.

Sy looked at Orion, who just moved to Kim to kiss her on the cheek. "I'll check in tonight, see you later Sy, have fun!"

"Wait, what?" Sy said. Before he could say anything else, Orion had left and shut the door. Chelsea was playing Animal Crossing on the Nintendo DS, and Kim had wandered into another room. Sy, not knowing what else to do, went to sit on the couch with Chelsea. "If that thing in you gives us any grief, I'll smack you so hard you'll pass out," Chelsea said, her eyes focused on her game.

"Yea well, I don't control it so," he said, noting the size of Chelsea's paws and claws, the last thing he wanted was to have those anywhere near his face. 

"Still, I'll knock you right out." Chelsea said calmly.

"Go bark in someone's else ears," Sy said, propping his feet up on the coffee table. Chelsea retaliated almost immediately, she kicked his feet off, and then smacked him hard in the head, knocking the glasses and hat right off.

"FUCK!" Sy yelled, recoiling and moving off the couch. "What the FUCK was that for?"

Chelsea smiled, "this is not your house. You can stay here, but you'll have to respect me, Kim and the furniture. If not, I'll hit you, simple as that,"

Kim stepped into the room just in time to see it happen. She watched Sy move to the other side of the room, to sit at the diner table. Again, he propped his feet up on the chair next to him. Kima met him at the table, pushed his feet off and sat next to him. "Chelsea didn't mean to hit you so hard, she forgets how frail we are, we humans I mean. Also, like... don't insult her, that's just plain common sense. She's big, she's got claws, and fangs, you did notice that right?"</p>

"What did Orion tell you about me," Sy asked then.

"That you're a cutthroat narcissistic callous creature," Kim said, noticing he was getting angry she laughed, "actually, he told me you were 'an adorable asshole'. His words. Anyway, everyone in town knows who you are."

<p>“Since you've agreed to give me shelter, what does that make you?” Sy asked her then, leaning on the arm of the chair to look at her, to try and see if he could read her.</p>

<p>Kim smiled, “I supposed it makes me an accomplice. I'm fine with it. Chel and & can handle ourselves, if something were to happen I mean." She explained, "I heard the stories you know, saw your grave. I knew deep down your body wasn't there." Kim paused for a moment, eyeing him over. "Orion came by last night, we talked about it. Figured it'd be interesting anyway, you probably don't remember but we made out once." she said, with a broad smile. There was something in her eyes, something honest, and fierce, he'd never met anyone like her. "Hope you got some practice since then, because it was like kissing a goat."</p>

<p>Sy laughed aloud then, amused by what she'd said. "That wasn't me," he said, "that didn't happen."

<p>"Because you don't remember something it doesn't mean it didn't happen, you were embarassed, you blocked it out. It's all good," she said, "gonna block out this conversation too then?"</p>

<p>"Get me mad, see what happens," Sy said, through gritted teeth, sick of this conversation.</p>

<p>"Oooh I'm so scared! You're flesh and bones like everyone else," Kim said. "You've been lucky all those times, that's what I think."</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about anything. Kindly fuck off." Sy said.</p>

<p>Kim neared her face to his, "no, you're careless Sy Cross," Kim told him, seeing some of the scars on his arms. "You've got to start earning some points with others, with me, and Chelsea and Orion for example, and you've got to make that happen real fast. Don't shut people out, you'll die die if you do." With this, Kim got up. "I'm going out, Chelsea watch him, and get some food in him before his body collapses in on itself and turns into a black hole."</p>

<p>Sy said nothing, he was actually very, very hungry. At the very mention of food, his stomach growled, loud enough for even their neighbors to hear.</p>

<h3>The feeding</h3>

Kim was gone for most of the day, but returned later that evening, Orion in tow, glad to find that Chelsea had not killed him.

Orion was dressed different, and had his hair slicked back, with a pair of sunglasses and a big bulky coat on. Her threw it off once he arrived inside. Orion thought it was a good idea to try and not look like himself coming here, he didn't want to blow Sy's cover. He pushed the glasses overtop his head, and joined Chelsea and Sy at the table. 

"You two friends yet?" Orion asked.

Chelsea snorted, "far from."

"What she said," Sy said, the left side of his face was swollen from Chelsea's pawing earlier on. "We decided that the best way not to get on each other's nerves was to not talk."

Orion placed a bag on the table, full of take-out containers, "wow, that's healthy," he said, placing the paper containers on the table while Kim went to gather dishes and cutlery. She returned and began to set everyone down, then she started opening containers. Everyone at the table started to fill their plates, and to eat their fill.

"I've eaten fuck all today by the way," Sy said, "I'm fucking dying."

"Chelsea..." Kim said, "I told you to-" Chelsea cut her off. "Before we decided on the no-talking rule he started looking through your things Kim, wouldn't answer when I asked him what he was doing. SO, I cut his access to food for the day."

"I was looking for something to read to amuse myself" he muttered.

Chelsea reached across the table and gripped Sy's wrist, "speak louder asshole."

Sy got up, fast, and pressed the tip of a large knife near her nose. "You want to see what happens when a psycho killer gets mad?"</p>

<p>Lightning fast, Chelsea put her hand on his hand with the blade, squeezing hard. Her head was already out of reach of his blade. Sy kept holding it, but couldn't move. Chelsea pressed harder then. Sy had no feeling in his fingers, and dropped the blade. Chelsea grabbed it, pressed the lever to release the blade, locked it, and threw it, tip first, into the ceiling. It was stuck up there for all to see.</p>

<p>Sy stared up at the knife, then at his wrist. Chelsea still held it.</p>

"Settle down, both of you." Orion said, he'd stopping eating, concerned for Chelsea, and for Sy.</p>

<p>Sy tried to jerk his arm back, but couldn't. Chelsea had a good grip, and was too strong for him. She stood up, reached over and pressed down on his head, forcing him to sit down. "Apologize to the table." 

<p>Kim was eating her food quietly, her eyes focused on her meal.</p>

<p>Sy said nothing, fuming in his seat.

"Say sorry," Chelsea commanded. Seeing as how he wasn't going to say anything, she began to twist his arm. Sy stiffened, he couldn't move. "I'm going to break it," Chelsea said, "it's nothing to me, and if you still won't say anything then i'll twist it all the way off." She twisted more, and more.</p>

<p>The pose was extremely painful. He winced, determined not to apologize.<br>
"Oh man, I feel sorry for you," Chelsea said, twisting harder. "You a lefty too eh? So sad."<br>
"FINE!" Sy shouted, "I'm sorry! I'm fucking sorry I'm alive!"<br>
"Boo fucking hoo, no one's partaking in your sad pity party Sy. Apologize, properly." Chelsea said.</p>

<p>Sy tried to calm down, the pain was started to go to his head. His eyes scanned the people at the table then. He took a deep breath. "Sorry," he managed to say.</p>

<p>Satisfied, Chelsea released him then, but kept her arm around his shoulders. Sy grabbed his own wrist, trying to get some feeling back into it. "Fetch me my knife," he said.</p>

<p>Chelsea laughed, "HA! SO Ballsy!"</p>

<p>"If you like pain, ask her again." Kim said, drinking some water. She then took her plate, and emptied the last of her potatoes into his plate. "Eat."</p>

<p>Sy was still angry, but also terribly, terribly hungry. He gave up, and remained quiet for the rest of the meal, eating up everything that was served to him.

After the meal, Chelsea retreated to her room, Orion stayed on a few hours but then left for home. Once they were alone, Kim got a ladder to bring the knife down from the ceiling. Kim slipped it back in his backpocket. "If you like this knife, don't be so trigger happy. It's a good blade, and Chelsea will break it next time."</p>

<h3>Saving Sy</h3>

<p>Sy was given a room in the large appartment. But he was sick of being indoors.

<p>One morning while watching Chelsea eating breakfast he just snapped. "I fucking can't stand this shit!" he yelled, "I hate this fucking appartment, I hate this FUCKING place."</p>

<p>Chelsea looked at him. "Scream if you must, but you ain't goin' nowhere. You gatta lay low bucko." she said, turning her attention to the morning paper.</p>

<p>"It's been long enough. Let's go out then," Kim said, walking into the kitchen suddenly. Sy's voice had traveled through all the rooms. Orion had told her to keep him indoors for a while, to stay low, but Kim didn't care. "I know a place."</p>

<p>Chelse looked at Kim then, setting the paper down again, "what did I just say?"</p>

<p>Kim walked behind Chelsea and wrapped her arms around her, hugging her tightly. "I know, but he needs some out time. And think of it this way, you'll have some alone time finally."</p>

<p>"M'yea, there's this novel I want to finish..." Chelsea said then, "fine. He leaves the knife here though."</p>

<p>Sy frowned at Chelsea, "what if I need it?"</p>

<p>"What if I turn you inside out?" Chelsea replied. "I'll ram my arm down your throat and grab your ass from inside and—"</p>

<p>"YIKES, okay. No knife, c'mon Sy. Let's go get you a drink." Kim said, moving over to Sy and pulling the knife out of his pocket, tossing it over to Chelsea's side. Sy was going to grab it again but Kim bonked him on the head. "Leave it."</p>

<p>Both were at a bar, already on their third drink. Sy was in a better mood. Kim was waiting to see if Sy was the kind that got sad when drunk, but he looked like he was the kind of guy who became happy when drunk, so she felt it was safe to ask...</p>

<p>"Feeling a little claustro then?" Kim asked him.</p>

<p>Sy nodded. "And I've read all your books."</p>

<p>"Chelsea's books you mean."</p>

<p>"Why is she so into true crime fiction? That's all you've got." Sy said, leaning back into his chair, "it sucks."</p>

<p>"Hm, be glad you weren't there for her thriller and suspense phase," she looked at him then, trying to see if she could guess the sort of book he was into. "You look like you enjoy Dystopian novels."</p>

<p>Sy smiled, but before saying anything he looked at her for a long while. People never tried to have conversations like this with him, it had a calming effect on him. Sy thought about a story then. "In Cyberiada, Trurl and Klapaucius are architects. They use their crazy tech abilities to help people on medieval planets. One time Trurl is captured by some interstellar pirate, he offers to build him a machine that can turn hydrogen into gold. But the pirate is super educated, and doesn't care for riches because if something valuable becomes abundant then it becomes cheap. He wants knowledge. So Trurl makes him an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that's encoded in their random perturbations. Like this, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless he's buried under the endless rolls of tape, and then stops to bother others."</p>

<p>Kim laughed, "that's good."</p>

<p>"Hoarding riches is a mental disease," Sy then said. "and so is hoarding knowledge for knowledge's sake."</p>

<p>"Agreed," Kim said, "are you trying to tell me something?"</p>

<p>"Tuseere." Sy said aloud, "I've seen you together."</p>

<p>Kim had not expected this at all. "So you have been going out, you liar." she said, grinning, "and you've been stalking me too. I'm flattered that I'm that interesting to you."</p>

<p>"Naw, I haven't been out of your place until today, but said you knew about me from before, well, I knew about you too," Sy began, "Nemerald keeps tabs on Tuseere, and because you two are involved you popped into our radar often. You called me careless before, I'd argue you're worse."</p>

<p>Kim got up and went to sit next to him, "aw, you really are concerned for me aren't you?" she said, nudging him.</p>

<p>"Yea, because I agree with Kozi. Tuseere is bad news."</p>

<p>"We're fine, seriously. I'm in control. But if they find out you're doing this, even that you once worked with Kozi then that could mean bad news for you." she paused for a moment, "the things you choose to do... do you secretly have a death wish?"</p>

<p>"What? Fuck no. Christ. Why does everyone think that? I need stimulation alright? That's why I do what I do. I want to be where shit happens, I'm fucking sick of hiding." He looked at her then, "and like," Sy paused, "would hate to see you get killed."</p>

<p>Kim put a hand on his shoulder. "Then let's come here every week, let's do 'stimulating things'. Fuck hiding." she said. "I'll introduce you to Tuseere, that encounter is sure to keep you entertained for a while."</p>

<p>Sy wasn't sure why he reacted this way, but he started to laugh, like what she had just said was the funniest thing he'd ever heard. "You've got a few screws loose," he said then.</p>

<p>“So do you,” she purred softly. She then took him tightly in her arms. Sy was taken aback, but he let it happen. "You can stay at my place for as long as you want, I'll tell Chelsea to back off. You can come and go as you please, I'll tell Orion too." she said to him.</p>

<p>"Tuseere won't be glad to meet me," he told her, "you two really involved?"</p>

<p>"We mess around," Kim said, "but we're not exclusive."</p>

<p>Sy gripped her hard then, "does Tuseere know this?" he said, his face nearing hers then, heart beating hard in his chest.</p>

<p>"Yes, they know." Kim could feel his heartbeat, her hands slid down his back, toward his hips, and brushed her lips against his left cheek. "Still think I'm fucking with you?"</p>

<p>Sy was drawn to her, to her strength and confidence. "Maybe, but now I just don't care." He just wanted to be near her, and so his lips moved to meet hers. They kissed for a long while. He couldn't tear himself away. He'd been alone for a long, long while, he couldn't remember the last time he'd been this close to anyone. Sy was starved for affection. Kim leaned into him, hands tugging at his clothes. "Let's go home hm?" she purred, leaving some cash on the table.</p></main><footer><p><a href='about.html'>Rekka Bellum</a> © 2009-2022 <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/'>BY-NC-SA 4.0</a> <a href='http://webring.xxiivv.com/#random'>Webring</a> <a href='https://github.com/rekkabell/kokorobot'>Github</a> <a href='https://merveilles.town/@rek'>Mastodon</a></p></footer></body></html>
