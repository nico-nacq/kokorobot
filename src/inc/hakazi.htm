<p>Hakazi (pronounced Ha-kah-zee) is a katkum, a passionate, but unstable character. There are times when he is abnormally energetic, happy and impulsive, during such times he is able to do great things, but often disregards how this can affect others. Then eventually he lapses into having a negative outlook on everything. When in a stable mood, he is able to make jokes and is a joy to be with, but otherwise he can be a handful.</p>

<p>While monkeywrenching he was shot in the head, and the {Solomons Devils} thought him dead. He survived, but was incarcerated in Liskar. His experience there robbed him of his confidence, the abuse and stress transformed his life in a very, very big way. Before this, Hakazi helped to create the environmental activists called the {Solomons Devils} with {Kaddali}.</p>
