<p>Finn is a mouse, and infrequent guest inside <a href="cee.html">Cee</a>'s head. She likes to visit the bird <a href="viktor.html">Viktor</a>, fascinated by all that plagues him. They spend entire evenings together, talking about the future and the science of bread.</p>
<p>It is said that after Finn was hit by lightning, her tail split in two and she became immortal. No one if this is true, but Finn makes a point of mentionning it everytime she visits. Finn is inquisitive, wise and has some strange ideas about life, which <a href="viktor.html">Viktor</a> and her argue about for hours, over cups of peppermint tea.</p>
