<hr>
<p>Caleb is a clever but very cautious person, it takes a lot for her to befriend anyone. She is {Seir}'s second hand and helps him run the {Ars Goetia}. Many would say that the organization would fail without her.</p>
<p>Cal spends most of her time in the Ars, having little interest in those her age.</p>

<p>Return to project {Hakum}.</p>
