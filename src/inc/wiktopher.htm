<h3>History of project</h3>
<p>The story of Wiktopher is an elaboration of a short film I did in 2008 called <b><a class="local" href="#uno">Uno</a></b>. This project was supposed to expand into a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QTsnRfFGXChVb-9x1fYY0Jdj6wTL8C_n/view?usp=sharing" class="external" target="_blank">comic</a>, which included many of the Wiktopher characters like Eka, Uno, Zucca, Lupin and Thirteen. I produced a lot of exploratory art for the project but the comic was never completed. Here is some art from that time, that may serve to give some context for the current version of Wiktopher:</p>
