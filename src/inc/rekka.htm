<p>I am currently based in the waters of the Pacific Northwest, where the weather is mild and kinder to sailboats, but my heart is in Qu√©bec.</p>
<p>I enjoy drawing by hand with ink, and am fond of long ocean passages, food preservation, cycling and birds (do ask me about cormorants). I make art for magazines, children's books, as well as visuals for software and games.</p>
<p>I've been making websites since I was a teenager, I would farm free geocities space by hot-linking between mutiple accounts. I've since abandoned that practice. These days, I enjoy making and maintaining simple websites. I manage <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank">GrimGrains</a>, <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank">100r.co</a>, <a href="https://wiktopher.ca" target="_blank">Wiktopher</a> and <a href="https://circacomic.kokorobot.ca" target="_blank">Circa Comic</a>.</p>
<p>Email me at <b>rekkabell @ gmail dot com</b> for art-related inquiries. You can also find me on <a rel="me" href="https://merveilles.town/@rek">Mastodon</a>. Keep up with updates to this site with <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/links/rss.xml" target="_blank">RSS</a>.</p>
