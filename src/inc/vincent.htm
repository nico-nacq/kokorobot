    <p>When I have access to shore power, I use <b>Vincent</b>, an old 2010 Macbook Pro with Manjaro(i3), a generous donation by my friend John Eternal.</p>

    <p>It draws more power than {Obi}, and the battery is mostly dead (it has 5 minutes of power independence). I've replaced the battery twice, the first one was a third-party battery and it lasted a year, the second was an Ifixit battery and its performance has also died quick.</p>

    <p>Accessories:</p>

    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Wacom One tablet(21x14.6cm)</li>
        <li>Bluetooth mouse</li>
    </ul>
