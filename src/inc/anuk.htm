<p>Anuk is a member of the {Solomons Devils}. She is their fastest runner. The Solos are her family, and she would do anything to keep them safe. Anuk is closest to Kaddali, and together they plan all missions for the group. She is generally quiet, but hears everything, one can always rely on her memory.</p>
