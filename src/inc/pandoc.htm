<h3><a id='whatispandoc'>What is Pandoc?</a></h3>

<p><a href='https://pandoc.org/index.html' target="_blank">Pandoc</a> is a terminal utility that converts files from one markup format into another. You can convert an HTML page to Markdown, Markdown to PDF, Markdown to EPUB etc. It's a useful tool to create articles, scientific papers, and books.</p>

<p>When generating PDFs, Pandoc's use of <a href='https://www.latex-project.org/' target="_blank">LaTeX</a> (a document preparation system) encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content.</p> 

<p>This is a list of notes I've compiled when came time to learn how to generate PDFs with Pandoc. This guide was made and tested on the <a href='https://elementary.io' target="_blank">Elementary</a> Linux distribution</p>

<h3><a id='markdown'>Pandoc Markdown</a></h3>

<p>Make sure that the text you want turned into a PDF has a <b>.txt</b> extension, and take note of the path to your project file, as you'll need that to generate your PDF later. The next step is to add Pandoc Markdown syntax to the text.</p>

<p><a href='https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html%23raw-tex' target="_blank">Pandoc Markdown</a> is an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber’s <a href='https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/' target="_blank">Markdown syntax</a>. Markdown is a simple, and easy-to-use markup language to format plain-text content. This language is used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.</p>

<p>For example, to make text <b>bold</b>, add two asterisks on each side of the word:</p>

<code>In January 2016, we bought our first sailboat, a **Yamaha 33**.</code>

<p>Hash symbols preceding a word or phrase make a heading. Be sure to add a space between the hash and the first word:</p>

<code>## Introduction</code>

<p>One hash would make the title bigger, three would make the heading smaller, four even smaller, five even smaller etc.</p>

<p>Once your text file has Markdown syntax, it is time to install Pandoc.</p>

<h3><a id='install'>Installing Pandoc on Linux</a></h3>

<p>To install pandoc on Linux, you can generally use your package manager or download the <a href='https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.11.2' target="_">latest version</a> from the website directly. You'll want to get <b>pandoc-2.11.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz</b>. When you've downloaded it, unzip the file, and move the folder (named pandoc-x.xx.x) to your Applications folder.</p>

<p>You've got Pandoc, but it's not usable yet. You've got to use the terminal to 'unpack' the files:</p>

<code>
cd ~/Applications
sudo dpkg -i ./pandoc-2.11.1
</code>

<p>After entering the above sudo command, you'll be asked for your <b>password</b>. Enter your password, and press enter to install Pandoc.</p>

<p>You should have the latest version of Pandoc installed, to verify the version, type the following in the command line:</p>

<code>pandoc --version</code>

<p>You'll see the name of the version on top, which in this case, is version <b>2.11.1.</b></p>

<code>pandoc 2.11.2
Compiled with pandoc-types 1.22, texmath 0.12.0.3, skylighting 0.10.0.3,
citeproc 0.2, ipynb 0.1.0.1

<p>You now have Pandoc installed on your computer.</p>

<h3><a id='latex'>Installing Tex Live</a></h3>

<p>For converting text files (written in Pandoc Markdown) to PDF, Pandoc makes use of LaTeX and XeTeX as the rendering engine. This is what will make your documents beautiful. Tex Live is a package specific to Linux, enter the following command to install it:</p>

<code>sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-generic-recommended</code>

<h3><a id='txtpdf'>From .txt. to pdf</a></h3>

<p>To generate a PDF from your .txt file (written in Pandoc Markdown), locate your project file using the terminal. Use <b>cd</b> — which stands for 'change directory' to <b>cd</b> to navigate to your project folder. The example below is if you'd saved your .txt file to Documents, under a folder named "myproject". Remember, caps matter when using <b>cd</b></p>

<code>cd Documents/myproject/</code>

<p>Enter the following command, replacing "filename" with the name of your .txt file, and "filename_export" with for the final exported PDF file:</p>

<code>filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex -o filename_export.pdf</code>

<p>In that same folder where you had your .txt file saved, you'll find your Pandoc-generated PDF!</p>

<h3><a id='extensions'>Using Pandoc Markdown Extensions</a></h3>

<p>In Pandoc, you can use Extensions (see below) to specify the output of your PDF more granularly, say if you want to change the paper size, add tables or footnotes etc.</p>

<h3><a id='papersize'>Changing papersize</a></h3>

<p>By default, the Pandoc PDF format is a4. If you want to change it, you'll have to add the following when generating the PDF in the command line:</p>

<code>--variable=geometry:a5paper</code>

<p>Appended with the rest, to generate the PDF from a .txt file, it'll look like this:</p>

<code>--variable=geometry:a5paper filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex -o filename_export.pdf</code>

<h3><a id='addext'>Adding extensions</a></h3>

<p>If you want add tables, you'll have to add an Extension. Extensions are specified in the command line when generating a PDF. In the example below, after <b>-- from markdown</b>, I've added a <b>+</b> followed by the extension <b>simple tables</b>. If the extension name has two words, adding an underscore between them is necessary.</p>

<code>--from markdown+simple_tables</code>

<p>You can add more extensions, adding a <b>+</b> inbetween each one. In the example below, I've added both <b>simple tables</b> and <b>citations</b>.</p>

<code>--from markdown+simple_tables+citations</code>

<p>Below is an example of a terminal command for a PDF generated from a .txt file, in a5 format, with the simple tables extension.</p>

<code>--variable=geometry:a5paper filename.txt --pdf-engine=xelatex --from markdown+simple_tables -o filename_export.pdf</code>
