<h3>Meds</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. {Hakazi}(uses the name Yegon now) has been on his own for a while in Montore after leaving the Solo Devs(yet again), following a fight with {Ikkard} and {Kaddali}. His symptoms are getting worse, he can no longer control his outbursts. To try and limit the damage he causes, he visits a clinic in Montore (owned by {Jak} and {Nemerald}) to try and get some meds.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p>Jak's second language is màkoua(French dialect), this explains why he doesn't pronounce certain words correctly (dis, dat instead this, that).</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spa possib - It's not possible, contraction of "Ce n'est pas possible"</li>
</ul>

<p>In this comic, Hakazi and Jak use the following Kataluk words:</p>

<ul>
<li>Koπzí - friends(but more than this), to come from the same tree(same community)</li>
<li>Recπa&atilde;t - alone</li>
<li>Betna - wish/pray</li>
<li>Seke- to do</li>
<li>Betnaseke - please, lit: to do pray/wish</li>
<li>Eiketk&atilde;t - ancient markings on hegata indicative of a strong Katkum spirit, lit: forest oath stripes</li>
<li>Youtka - war paint</li>
</ul>
