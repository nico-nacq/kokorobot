    <h2>Cat Clock</h2>
    <p>I designed a custom kit-cat klock utility for <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a>.</p>
    <p>Visit the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/catclock' target='_blank'>cat clock repository</a> to learn how to run it.</p>

<p>Inspired by the art deco novelty wall clock "the Kit-Cat Klock". The clock was made into a desktop utility for Plan 9, and we wanted to have a custom design for Uxn.</p>

<p>See our <a href='../media/content/project/catclock/catclock.gif'>Kit-Cat Klock gif animation[201.8 kB]</a>.</p>

<p>This project was drawn and animated entirely in <a href='https://100r.co/site/nasu.html' target='_blank'>Nasu</a>. The image below is the cat clock sprite file, with all of the frames for the 'eyes'.</p>

<p>The cat also has an animated tail, but this portion was separated into another .chr file.</p>

<p>The animation is 8 frames, and mirrored horizontally to make 16 frames in all.</p>
