<hr>
<p>Sy is known in the community, and gets along well enough with those in Tusky but not with anyone outside of this circle. Sy is often mixed in turf wars, between his city and those that share its border.</p>
<p>Sy grew up with few rules, and little direction. Because of this he's always lived on his own terms.</p>
<p>He has an explosive temper, it doesn't take much to set him off. He is callous, but honest and doesn't like to lie. Sy's lack of foresight never fails to get him into trouble, and because he fears little, he will boldly stand in the face of a menacing character.</p>
