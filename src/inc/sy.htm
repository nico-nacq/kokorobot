<hr>
<p>Sy is known in the community as a troublemaker, a person you just don't cross (ha). He grew up with few rules, and little direction, because of this he's always lived on his own terms.</p>

<p>He has an explosive temper, it doesn't take much to set him off. He is callous, but honest and doesn't lie. Sy's lack of foresight never fails to get him into trouble, and because he fears little, he will boldly stand in the face of a menacing character. In general, Sy is a pretty tempestuous guy, but he also loves life, and in his own fatalistic way he remains an optimist.</p>
