<p>I am a non-binary cartoonist and sailor.</p>

<p>I am currently based in the waters of the Pacific Northwest, where the weather is mild and kinder to sailboats, but my heart is in Québec. I enjoy drawing by hand with ink, and am fond of long ocean passages, small web, cycling and birds (do ask me about cormorants).</p>

<p>With the project <a href='100r.html'>HundredRabbits</a>, I write about permacomputing, practical liveaboard skills/knowledge, and food preservation, while producing fun art projects with <a href='devine.html'>Devine</a>.</p>

<p>I make art for magazines, children's books, as well as visuals for software and games (see <a href='publications.html'>publications</a>). My first self-published game <a href='oquonie.html'>Oquonie</a> was nominated for a visual arts award at the <a href='https://igf.com/2015' target="_blank">2015 Independent Games Festival</a> in San Francisco. In 2020 I published <a href='busy_doing_nothing.html'>Busy Doing Nothing</a>, a book documenting my 50-day sail from Shimoda to Victoria.</p>

<p>I spend their days documenting repairs on the boat, <a href='grimgrains.html'>food experiments</a>, as well as making small games, art and toys. I also take <a href='ink.html'>commissions</a>.</p>

<p>I lived in <a href='japan.html'>Japan</a> for two years(2012-2014), and after returning to Canada I decided to try and return there by sailboat. And so, from 2016 to 2020, I circumnavigated the Pacific Ocean by sail, passing through Mexico, French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands and Japan.</p>

<p>I've been making websites since I was a teenager, I would farm free geocities space by hot-linking between mutiple accounts—I've since abandoned that practice. These days, I enjoy making and maintaining simple websites. I manage <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank"></a>, <a href='https://grimgrains.com' target="_blank">GrimGrains</a>, <a href="https://100r.co" target="_blank">100r.co</a>, <a href="https://wiktopher.ca" target="_blank">Wiktopher</a> and <a href="https://circacomic.kokorobot.ca" target="_blank">Circa Comic</a>.</p>

<h3>Small online community involvement</h3>

<p>In the early 2000's I was known as "Esse" online. I was active in the FDD(fictional digidestined) community, with the websites <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20021007214756/http://www.geocities.com/essedungamon/' target='_blank'>The Forgotten Digidestined</a>(2001-2006), <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20040126123046/http://www.injenn.net/~EsseRawks/' target='_blank'>Esse's Digimon Adoptions</a>(2002-2005) later, EDA became <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20050403230306/http://www.sagari-cross.com/homepage.html' target='_blank'>Sagari-Cross</a>(2005-2009) hosted by Legend (injenn.net) until I started self-hosting the site myself. I hosted a forum (Zephopolis) where I would roleplay characters with friends. Back then, roleplaying with friends online was a big part of my life. In 2005 Sagai-Cross became predominantly a portfolio website. It's sad that this happened. In 2011 I changed their domain name to kokorobot.ca.</p>

<p>Later, I discovered art hosting sites like <a href='https://www.deviantart.com/esserawks' target='_blank'>DeviantArt</a>(also <a href='https://www.deviantart.com/mintenko' target='_blank'>Mintenko</a>) and SheezyArt, and spent a lot of time on CFSL and the <b>Isopharmacy</b> forums. Isopharmacy was an artistic community, we would create art challenges and talk about art, games etc. In 2010, myself and Devine created the studio <a href="drownspire.html">Drownspire</a>. Together we designed and sold small figurines (vambits), apparel, jewellery and books. At the time, I helped organized <b>Drink & Draw</b> events in Montreal. These events inspired the creation of art books (Erri) and the comic collective Merure. We released 3 Merure books in total, under the non-profit name of MachineMachine.</p>

<p>Now, I hang around the <a href="https://merveilles.town/">Merveilles instance</a> on Mastodon.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>In high school, I enjoyed working with wood and worked on many <a href="physical.html">art projects</a>.</p>
<p>I did a two-year creative arts program at the Champlain Regional College on the south shore of Montreal(2002-2004), where I learned how to do digital art, movie-making, as well as sculpture and painting (it was a very varied program). While there, I helped found the Visual Arts Club in the school.</p>

<p>Then I attended the Cégep du Vieux Montréal and enrolled in their excellent 2d animation course(2005-2008), where I produced the short film <a href="uno.html">uno</a>.</p>

<p>From 2007 to 2016, I worked in-house at a variety of art, game and animation studios like Mandarine 24, Volta, Pascal Blais Studio and Sava Transmédia. In 2012, I moved to Japan and worked at a—then small— animation studio in Shinjuku. They moved back to Montréal in 2014 and worked at Hibernum Créations and Télé-Québec. Throughout my career, I did a lot of freelance work for edition companies, illustrating children's books for ERPI, Boréal, Courte-Echelle, Transcontinental, Druide, Bayard Canada etc. After 2016, I focused on making projects for <a href="100r.html">Hundred Rabbits</a>.<p>
