<hr>
<p>Kaddali is the leader, and tinkerer of the Solo Devs, one whose brain never seems to go offâ€” not even in sleep. Kaddali, also known as "Kidd", hates being indoors, preferring a contact with the sky and the earth, always. In fact, Kidd is very attuned with nature, constantly observing patterns in the living world and translating this into new creations.</p>
<p>As a child, he was brought at a boarding school for Hegatas. He left before his ears were cut off, taking <a href='yegon.html'>Yegon</a> along.</p>
<p>Kidd believes in voluntary simplicity and sees possessions, extravagances and religion as obstacles to mental clarity. Nowadays, they do less art, and all of their energy goes into fighting human encroachment on nature. His tactics are growing more violent, causing tension in the group, resulting in Yegon leaving.</p>
