<hr>
<p>Kaddali is the tinkerer of the group, one whose brain never seems to go off â€” not even in sleep. Kaddali, also known as "kidd", hates being indoors, preferring a contact with the sky and the earth, always. In fact, Kidd is very attuned with nature, constantly observing patterns in the living world and translating this into new creations.</p>
<p>Kidd believes in simplicity and sees possessions, extravagances and religion as obstacles to mental clarity.</p>
