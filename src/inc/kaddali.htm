<hr>
<p>Kaddali is the current acting leader of the Solomon's Devils(Solo Devs). They use the name Kidd to help mask their identity.</p>
<p>They come from a small community that tattoos the noses of members black when they come of age. Kaddali was estranged from that community because many did not care for their extreme activism.</p>
<p>Kaddali is highly attuned to the emotions of others, but also has trouble regulating their own.</p>
