<p>Kaddali is the current acting leader of the Solomon's Devils(Solo Devs). When Hakazi 'died' ze reluctantly took up the role, but ze is a just, cautious leader, and the group has been all the better for it. Ze is highly attuned to the emotions of others, but also has trouble regulating hir own. Kaddali is the only one that can handle <a href='daedante.html'>Dae</a>.</p>
<p>Ze comes from a conservative tribe called the "baarit", they are tight-knit and rarely mix with humans or other tribes. Kaddali was estranged from that community because of diverging values. Baarit tribe tattoos the noses of members black when they come of age.</p>
