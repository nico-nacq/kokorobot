<hr>
<p>Kaddali is a katkum, and the current acting leader of the {Solomons Devils}. When Hakazi 'died' hea reluctantly took up the role, but hea is a just, cautious leader, and the group has been all the better for it. Hea is highly attuned to the emotions of others, but also has trouble regulating thea own. Kaddali is the only one that can handle {Dae}.</p>

<p>Return to project {Hakum}.</p>
