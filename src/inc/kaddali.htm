<hr>
<p>Kaddali is the current acting leader of the {Solomons Devils}. When Hakazi 'died' hea reluctantly took up the role, but hea is a just, cautious leader, and the group has been all the better for it. Hea is highly attuned to the emotions of others, but also has trouble regulating thea own. Kaddali is the only one that can handle {Dae}.</p>
<p>Hea comes from a conservative group called the "baarit", they are tight-knit and rarely mix with humans or other tribes. Kaddali was estranged from that community because of diverging values. Baarit tattoos the noses of members black when they come of age.</p>

<p>Return to project {Hakum}.</p>
