<hr>
<p>Kaddali is the leader of the Solo Devs, one whose brain never seems to go offâ€” not even in sleep. Kaddali, also known as "Kidd", hates being indoors, preferring a contact with the sky and the earth, always. In fact, Kidd is very attuned with nature, constantly observing patterns in the living world.</p>
<p>As a child, they attended at a boarding school for Hegatas. Kidd left before their ears were cut off, taking <a href='yegon.html'>Yegon</a> along. After their escape they founded the Solomon's Devils, with Kaddali taking the lead. Both were into a relationship at the time.</p>
<p>Kidd believes in voluntary simplicity and sees possessions, gender, extravagances and religion as obstacles to mental clarity. All of their energy goes into fighting human encroachment on nature. Their tactics were growing very violent, causing tension in the group and resulting in Yegon leaving. Yegon's departure embittered Kaddali, who still had feelings for him.</p>
