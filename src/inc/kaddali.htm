<p>Kaddali is the leader of the Solo Devs, one whose brain never seems to go offâ€” not even in sleep. Kaddali, also known as "Kidd", hates being indoors, preferring a contact with the sky and the earth, always. In fact, Kidd is very attuned with nature, constantly observing patterns in the living world. They refuse to go anywhere indoors.</p>
<p>They and Azi(Yegon) met at a protest against the construction of a pipeline in Tuskatora. They quickly became inseparable, and eventually Kaddali fell for him. Kaddali loved Azi more than they'd ever loved anyone. They saw eye to eye on nearly everything. They continued to attend protests together, but their aim was to disrupt development, or logging projects in the Taiga, to make clear to humans that Hegatas are a force to be reckoned with, and to stay away. Together, they created the Ars Goetia, and began to recruit members. They want to keep humans out the North (where the Taiga is, and the ancients sleep).</p>
<p>When Kaddali thought Azi had died, their tactics grew very violent. Seir had joined them then, and he and Kaddali kept arguing and eventually the group was split in two. Seir led the Ars Goetia, and Kaddali created the Solomon's Devils, taking Daedante, Anuk, and Yinifer with him. Kaddali's biggest loss was Adelie, the only active ancient in Montore, who decided to stay with Seir.</p>
<p>Kaddali recruited Ikkard last, and Ikkard brought over yet another recruit named Yegon. Kaddali recognized him right away. They could not believe it was him at first, but was so happy to find him alive. This happiness quickly turned to bitterness, because Yegon had not told them he was alive... but soon, Kaddali understood why. Yegon had suffered a lot in the hands of Liskar, and after the accident with the K-Firsts. He was different, and no longer shared his thirst for extreme violence against humans. Kaddali could see very little of Azi in him now, and while he did care for Yegon he could not stop wanting Azi to be here instead of him. Yegon could tell, and left the group not too long after, knowing things would never be the same between them. He left during a mission to capture and kill a celebrity for media attention. Yegon and Ikkard were tasked with it, but Yegon saved the human before Ikkard could take his life and ran away to Kozi's lab, hoping that this act would earn him a place into the Ars Goetia.</p>
<p>Yegon leaving once again turned Kaddali mad, and they were then determined to throw ever more violence at the humans who did this to him. His hatred for Seir was still fresh then, even more so when they learned that Yegon had joined up with the Ars.</p>
