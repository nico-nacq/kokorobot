<hr>
<p>Dante is a Hegata who occasionally fights with Kaddali's Solomon's Devils. He is extremely agile and strong for his size. He is also loyal, but became less present after he saw Azi die. Dante returned to live in the taiga full time after his death, but would return to the Solo's a few times a year to check in on them, and to assist them on various missions. No one in the group knows what he does in his free time in the taiga.</p>

<p>Dante doesn't talk about his past, or himself to anyone, ever.</p>

<p><b>Past.</b> The night Azi was shot, Dante was there. He saw Azi shot, and die. He thought him dead. Before leaving, he attacked the officer, severely wounding him, and continued their mission. After that Dae evaded police, hiding in the woods, alone for many weeks.</p>
