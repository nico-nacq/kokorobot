<hr>
<p>Dante is a Hegata but doesn't live with the others, he never has. He shows himself to few, and speaks little of himself.</p>
<p>Dante is nimble, making an enemy of him is a dangerous thing. He fears neither pain nor death, most will run at the sight of him. No one knows where his allegiance lies, if anywhere at all...</p>
