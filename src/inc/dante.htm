<hr>
<p>Dante is a Hegata who occasionally fights with Kaddali's Solomon's Devils. He shows himself to few, and speaks little of himself.</p>
<p>Dante is nimble, making an enemy of him is a dangerous thing. He fears neither pain nor death. He is fickle. No one knows where his allegiance truly lie, if anywhere at all... but he fights both humans, and hegatas if the occasion calls for it.</p>
