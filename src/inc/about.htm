<p>Kokorobot is a mix of <b>kokoro</b> (heart, in Japanese) and <b>robot</b> to mean robot heart. It is meant to have a French pronunciation. It dates back to 2011, see the <a href='../media/interface/oldlogo.png'>former logo</a>[95.4 kB] for the website. </p>

<p>The author <b><a href="rek.html">Rek</a></b> lives aboard a <b><a href="pino.html">sailboat</a></b> somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>See what they are <b><a href="books.html">reading</a></b> right now, and what <b><a href="tools.html">tools</a></b> they are using. Rekka is a name that they chose, inspired from the name Rakka in the anime Haibane Renmei.</p>

<h3>Website concepts</h3>

<img src="../media/content/sketch/conceptwebsite_dt.png" class="tools"/>

<p>Below is the rough concept for the menu icons of kokorobot.ca. I sketched them on paper, photographed them with a shitty laptop camera and cleaned it up in Krita. I was inspired by Shaun Tan's <a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20150205230923/https://www.shauntan.net/' target='_blank'>old website</a> (the recent version is not nearly as fun).</p>
