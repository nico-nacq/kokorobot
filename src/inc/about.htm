<p>Kokorobot is a mix of <b>kokoro</b> (heart, in Japanese) and <b>robot</b> to mean robot heart. It is meant to have a French pronunciation. It dates back to 2011, see the <a href='../media/interface/oldlogo.png'>former logo</a>[95.4 kB] for the website. </p>

<p>I,<b><a href="rek.html">Rek</a></b>, live aboard a <b><a href="pino.html">sailboat</a></b> somewhere in the Salish Sea.</p>

<p>See what I'm <b><a href="books.html">reading</a></b> right now, and what <b><a href="tools.html">tools</a></b> I'm using. Rekka is a name that I chose, inspired from the name Rakka in the anime Haibane Renmei.</p>

<h3>Website concepts</h3>

<p>Above is the rough concept for the menu icons of kokorobot.ca. I sketched them on paper, photographed them with a shitty laptop camera and cleaned it up in Krita.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>A short post to make it clear where I stand as a person, and with my work.</p>

<p>I am <b>committed</b> to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in questi
on the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>

<p>I am <b>aggressively</b> opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds.</p>
