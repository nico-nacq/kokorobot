    <h2>Catpot</h2>
    <p>This little cooking game was made by myself and <a href='devine.html'>Devine</a> over two days for the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/merveilles-hyperjam/entries' target='_blank'>Merveilles Hyperjam</a> in <b>April 2020</b>.</p>
    <p>See the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOyQU0oRvs8' target='_blank'>Longplay video</a>(YouTube) of the game.</p>

<p>"Help Cat in the kitchen. Cat is hungry."</p>

<p>This jam was to teach people how to use Hypercard, a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers by Bill Atkinson. Find out <a href='https://cancel.fm/hyperjam/' target='_blank'>how to emulate a Macintosh II</a>.</p>

<p>We made this game jam while in Japan, not long before our <a href='busydoingnothing.html'>crossing of the Pacific Ocean</a>. Many participants were in lockdown in their homes because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Drawing in Hypercard is actually really great? I had a lot of fun with this.</p>
