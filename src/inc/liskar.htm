<h3>Liskar</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. After his accident, Hakazi({Yegon}) is incarcerated in Liskar. His injuries make it difficult for him to communicate, and he feels more alone than ever, but his stay there is made better when he meets a fellow inmate</p>

<p><b>Hand Speak</b>. In this sequence, I used Hand Speak, or Plain Sign Talk. It is a trade language, formerly trade pidgin, that was once the lingua franca across what is now central Canada, the central and western United States and northern Mexico, used among the various Plains Nation. I was going to use {ASL}(American Sign Language) in this comic, but after learning about Hand Speak I decided to use that instead, because it predates ASL, and because it is knowledge worth passing on. The signs differ from ASL.</p>

<p>I've added Hand Speak images from Universal Indian Sign Language by William Tokins(published in 1926). It is worth noting that although the book title uses the word 'Indian', and that the language is sometimes called 'Plains Indian Sign Language', it is is considered pejorative by many who are Indigenous, especially in Canada.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon. Also, I am adding pages as I finish them.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>. <i>Some violence, blood.</i><br><b>[Status: incomplete]</b></p>

<p>In Hand Speak, "My name is Hakazi," is " I - Called - Growing - Tree."</p>
