<h3>Liskar</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. After his accident, Hakazi({Yegon}) is incarcerated in Liskar. His injuries make it difficult for him to communicate, and he feels more alone than ever, but his stay there is made better when he meets a fellow inmate</p>

<p><b>Hand Speak</b>. In this sequence, I used Hand Speak. It is a trade language, formerly trade pidgin, that was once the lingua franca across what is now central Canada, the central and western United States and northern Mexico. I was going to use {ASL}(American Sign Language) in this comic, but after learning about Hand Speak I decided to use that instead.</p>

<p>I've added Hand Speak images(drawn by A. J. Stover) from a by William Tokins(published in 1926).</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p>Some Kataluk words used in this comic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oteyo - hello.</li>
<li>ZÃ­ - tree.</li>
<li>Haka - growing.</li>
<li>O&otilde;kle - sibling, or someone you share feelings with and that you are close to.</li>
<li>O&otilde;kledo&utilde; - term of endearment, to mean little sibling.</li>
<li>Do&utilde; - appended to names, or words to mean 'little', or used for someone for whom you care about. Ex: Daedou (Dae being a name).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Warning</b>. <i>Some violence, blood.</i><br><b>[Status: finished]</b></p>
