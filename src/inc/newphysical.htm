<p>A variety of physical works, done for fun.</p>

<h3>Sushi chef Galeru</h3>

<p>A modded Munny (designer toy). Ears, eyebrows and fur were made of Sculpey polymer clay, body was painted with acrylic. Shoes and hat were made with a 3d printer out of PLA.</p>

<p>Galeru was a fictional digimon I made up, and continued to use in other non-digimon related art. In another universe, Galeru was a sushi chef. Made in 2012.</p>

<h3>Kyoudai</h3>

<p>Kyoudai means siblings in Japanese. This is brother and sister, two sculptures that go together. Made in 2008</p>

<p>Made during a time when I liked making physical sculptures out of wooden blocks of equal size, like pixel art. I would glue the blocks together in a specific shape and paint overtop.</p>

<h3>Merveilles</h3>

<p>A character based out of the Merveilles game made by my partner Devine. Made in 2008.</p>

<p>Made using the same technique as Kyoudai, except that the blocks were stained with paint to get a lighter, more natural color.</p>
