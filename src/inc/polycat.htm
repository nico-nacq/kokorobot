<p>Polycat is a wanderer, she doesn't speak much, but a lot can be understood by looking into her eye. She seems to always appear when <a href="shiba.html">Shiba Killy</a> is alone, following after him and disappearing as soon as anyone else comes near.</p>
<p>She likes to assist Shiba Killy in various tasks, like when he makes stone mandalas in the woods. She can multiply herself at will, but the others have the rear ends of other animals, like aves, vulpes and ungulates.</p>
<p>Want to <b><a href="https://neauoire.github.io/polycat/" class="external" target="_blank">play</a></b> with Polycat?</p>
