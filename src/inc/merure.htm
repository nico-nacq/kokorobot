    <h2>What is Merure?</h2>
    <p>Merure was a comic anthology published by Drownspire, a non-profit collective created by myself and <a href='https://xxiivv.com'>Devine</a>. The collective published 3 full-color volumes from 2008 to 2010, with short comics by 10-15 artists from Montreal. The comics below are the ones I made that were included in the first two volumes. The physical volumes are now out of print.</p>
