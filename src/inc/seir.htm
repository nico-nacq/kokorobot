<hr>
<p>He is the founder of the <b>Ars Goetia</b>, an organization composed of hegatas (half humans) and an eidola (full demon).</p>
<p>Seir believes that in order to make the change he wants in the world that he has to change human minds, and this translates to getting involved with humans in their own territory. Seir doesn't believe in the work of the Solo Devs, thinking that only getting higher in human ranks, owning property, companies and assets, will make a difference. Seir hopes to amass enough money and power to buy eidola land to ensure their protection, and future governance.</p>
<p>Seir has worked hard to become infuential in Montore to change human law to benefit his people. He loves to defy humans and to change the rules, he thrives on it, always looking for new ways to piss them off. Seir lives in luxury, with multiple opulent houses scattered around town.</p>
<p>Many accuse Seir of being greedy, of losing sight of his goals for his people, blinded by riches and success. Little is known of Seir's past.</p>
