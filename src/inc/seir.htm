<p>Seir believes that in order to make the change Hegatas want in the world that they have to change human minds, and this translates into getting involved with humans on their terms, to speak 'their' language. Seir plays by their rules, amassing enough money and power to buy land in the Taiga to ensure their protection, and future governance.</p>
<p>Seir has worked hard to become infuential in Montore to change human law to benefit his people. He loves to defy humans and to change the rules, he thrives on it, always looking for new ways to piss them off.</p>
