<p>Seir believes that in order to make the change Hegatas want in the world that they have to change human minds, and this translates into getting involved with humans on their terms, to speak 'their' language. Seir plays by their rules, amassing enough money and power to buy land in the Taiga to ensure their protection, and future governance.</p>
<p>Seir has worked hard to become infuential in Montore, to the supposed benefit of his people, but he is blind to many things happening around him. Seir is often accused of using his activism as a platform to enrich himself.</p>
