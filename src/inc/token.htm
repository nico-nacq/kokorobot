<hr>
<p>Token is a professional boxer, known country-wide for his exceptional skills. He is generous and well-liked. He has many good relationships with a lot of people, but hardly any close friendships. Token avoids it. His personal space is his own, and he allows no one else to dig too deep. He's only had aromantic relationships with others.</p>

<p>He was abused by his father as a child, a secret that only his brother and Sy know about. Token worked all his life to bury the memories, but it is a stain that cannot simply be rubbed out. Token relies on antidepressants to function, and avoids counseling due to shame.</p>

<p>He is very strong and spends most his time working out.</p>

<p>He lost a section of his arm and fingers after a brawl with a local gang that bet on fighters. Nemerald offered Token a prosthetic, but nothing in this world is free. Token has had to venture in Circa often on his behalf. His prosthetic mirrors the weight and length of his other arm while being safe (and fair) against other opponents. It mimics the anatomical shape of a closed fist and has the same impact as a human hand, while remaining durable during rounds of sparring.</p>

<p>The accident, while difficult, has thrown Token onto a better, healthier path. He was forced to seek help for his depression, and he travels the country to raise money for lower-income amputated athletes. Token also met Mari, an abled and aro fighter, whom he now shares a home with.</p>
