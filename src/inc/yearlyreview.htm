<h3>Year-end reviews</h3>

<p>A year-end review is a look back on what I accomplished in a year.</p>

<p>I wish I'd kept up with this tradition since 2013, but as you can see, there is a big gap between 2014 and 2020. Perhaps I did not write a year-end review for those 6 years because I was having too much fun? Naw, truth is I forgot, it's a shame, but it's the truth! I collected what I did write here, enjoy?</p>
