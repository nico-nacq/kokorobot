<p>Cee is a jittery character, plagued and paralyzed by fear and anxiety, due to the precense of a bird in her head. <a href="viktor.html">Viktor</a>, the bird, took up residence in Cee's head early in her life, and cannot be persuaded to leave.</p>
<p>Cee likes to grow plants, and spends a lot of time alone or with <a href="shiba.html">Shiba Killy</a>, her most trusted friend. Another comes to nest into her head on occasion, an immortal mouse named <a href="finn.html">Finn</a>.</p>
