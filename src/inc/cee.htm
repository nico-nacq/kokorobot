<p>Cee is a jittery character, plagued and paralyzed by fear and anxiety, due to the precense of a bird in her head. <b><a class="local" href="#viktor">Viktor</a></b>, the bird, took up residence in Cee's head early in her life, and cannot be persuaded to leave.</p>
<p>Cee likes to grow plants, and spends a lot of time alone or with <b><a class="local" href="#shiba">Shiba Killy</a></b>, her most trusted friend. Another comes to nest into her head on occasion, an immortal mouse named <b><a class="local" href="#finn">Finn</a></b>.</p>
