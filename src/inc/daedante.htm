<p>Dae is known as the Terror of the Taiga(ToT). He single-handedly disrupted logging and pipeline projects in the Taiga for years. He is fast, strong, and knows more about the Taiga than anyone. Dae is mostly quiet, unless he disagrees with someone. He doesn't care to pamper others. Dae is a very fast healer, recovering quicker than most Hegatas.</p>
<p>Dae joined the Solomon's Devils early on to teach them the ropes, fearing that their tactics were inneffective. He is there to teach them to take initiative, to employ artifice, and to always remain at offense.</p>
<p><b>Fighting style</b>. Dae specializes in hand-to-hand combat, oriented primarily towards self-defense and restraint, concentrating on rapid disabling of an opponent with potentially lethal force. His aim is to end a confrontation as quickly as possible using "ungentlemanly" means by rapidly attacking vital spot area (such as the groin, throat, side of the neck, shin, eyes, ears, etc.) by using only several pragmatic and powerful strikes.<p>

<p>Dae became more closed off after he saw Hakazi 'die', he doesn't talk about his past, or himself to anyone, ever.</p>
