<hr>

<p>Bru is a tinkerer. She loves taking things apart to try and understand how they work. She's everyone's go-to person for an engine, or leaky roof. Her room is full of boxes with random bits and pieces whose purpose is not directly evident, but she always finds a use for everything. Bru can fix anything, but she hates electronics. She loves hand tools, especially for woodworking (she always carries a blade for carving). She's also deepy fascinated with mushrooms, and goes out for nature walks often to forage for them.</p>

<p>She shares an appartment with {Orion} in downtown Montore. She sometimes helps out at the bar where he works.</p>

<p>Bru is very hard-headed, and hyper-focused person. She has difficulty breaking away from a task, disappearing from social circles for days until said task is finished. She speaks mostly French, and often forgets to address people in English.</p>
