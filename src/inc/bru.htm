<p>Bru is a tinkerer. She loves taking things apart to try and understand how they work. She's everyone's go-to person for fixing a broken electronic, or even a leaky roof. Her room is full of boxes with random bits and pieces whose purpose is not directly evident, but she always finds a use for everything. She's also deepy fascinated with mushrooms, and goes out for nature walks often to forage for them.</p>

<p>She shares an appartment with <a href='orion.html'>Orion</a> in downtown Montore. She sometimes helps out at the bar where he works.</p>

<p>Bru is very hard-headed, and hyper-focused person. She has difficulty breaking away from a task, disappearing from social circles for days until said task is finished. </p>
