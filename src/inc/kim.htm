<hr>
<p>Kim is relatively easy-going, mostly relaxed, and tries to not burden herself with worry and fear. In dangerous situations, she can fend for herself all while protecting the ones she cares about.</p>

<p>Kim is loosely part of the {Ars Goetia}, being friend to {Seir}. She is the only person that can keep {Sy} in line.</p>

<p>Return to project {Hakum}.</p>
