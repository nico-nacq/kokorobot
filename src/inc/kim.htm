    <li><b>Name</b>: Kim Horizon </li>
    <li><b>Story</b>: {Hakum}</li>
    <li><b>Gender</b>: Cis female</li>

<p>Kim is a human, relatively easy-going, she sees details that others tend to miss, and isn't easily tricked. Kim is quick-witted, and just as quick to act in dangerous situations. It is better to remain on her good side, because she is a very strong fighter, and like Sy, doesn't value of the lives of people she doesn't respect.</p>

<p>Kim is close to Chelsea, an Alekum that takes on the form of a collie in public. The two are soul-bonded. Their relationship makes Kim even more dangerous, because Chelsea will do anything to keep her safe.</p>

<p>Kim is loosely part of the {Ars Goetia}, being friend to {Seir}. She is the only person that can keep {Sy} in line.</p>

<p>Return to project {Hakum}.</p>
