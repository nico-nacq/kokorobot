<h3>The ToT</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. This sequence follows the {chase}, where Dae was shot with an arrow laced with aconite. He is on the mend, but impatient. He is staying in Kozi's clinic. Seir, head of the Ars Goetia, and an old friend, comes to see how he's doing.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing.</i><br><b>[Status: unfinished]</b></p>
