    <h2>Vancouver Island mushroom series</h2>
    <p>British Columbia is home to many wonderful mushrooms. Vancouver Island in particular, is a great location for learning about and foraging mushrooms. I made this series to learn about local varieties, and also because I love getting lost into their details.</p>
    <p>I started this series in December 2021.</p>
