<h3>Ayerli'kum</h3>

<p>Yesterday.</p>

<p>Two teenage boys were in the woods, . Sy was going around, picking up small stones and gathering them in his shirt. Token was sitting in a clearing, waiting for him. His face was terribly bruised.</p>

<p>"So, why would Oss choose <i>you</i> anyway?"</p>

<p>"Cause we've got something to offer each other," Sy replied.</p>

<p>"But Ren will not have chosen me..."</p>

<p>"So what, at least you'll be able to disappear before your asshole dad's fist nears your face next time." Sy said as he began to line up the rocks he had picked up in a small circle, encircling Token. Sy drew a symbol in the center with branches, creating a diamond shape. Sy went to join him inside, and held out his hand to him. "Don't let go," he instructed. Then he raised his other hand, "touch your thumb on the lower phalange of your first finger, then on the third..." Sy finished the sequence, and then both boys disappeared.</p>

<h3>Tar boy</h3>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>25 year old Sy was atop a mountain in Circa, sitting and watching the world around him. It was peaceful up here, but Sy was feeling restless. He could feel it in his skin, and in his bones. He could no longer rest at night. He knew the mountain area by heart, and on that day he decided to leave it, to try and find the place where he'd first landed with Token, for the hell of it. If Nemerald asked why he'd left, he'd say he had spotted a demon out here. Sy spent most of his time spying on others in Circa for him, so it wouldn't be weird to say at all. The mountain was protected with a strong spell, Sy knew where that barrier ended. He stepped out, and began to wander into the woods. It was eerily quiet.</p>

<p>After a while he found their spot again. He bent down and laid a hand over a spot in the ground, he could no longer see it, but he knew that's where the symbol had been. The air smelled different here, it smelled sour, burnt. Then he realized that the smell was not a what, but a who...</p>

<p>A boy stood in front of him, grinning. His lips were bright red, and his eyes were two unending black pools. His skin appeared dry, cracked.</p>

<p>Sy stared, he had expected to run into someone, but he was ready. In fact, he was itching for a fight. "What'chu lookin' at?" he said. The boy did not say anything. "Ugly little shit..."</p>

<p>"Yessss," the boy said.</p>

<p>"Yes you are an ugly little shit." Sy said with a laugh, standing up again. He appeared disappointed that the boy didn't appear aggressive, despite appearing aggressive. "Fuck. I am so bored..."</p>

<p>"Yessss..." the boy said again. The boy turned around and walked off then.</p>

<p>Because Sy was bored, and against all good reason, he decided to follow him. They exited the woods and arrived in a long yellow desert. The transition from green to yellow was incredibly abrupt. Sy saw the boy at the top of a mound ahead, and then saw him as he began to sink into the ground, facing Sy, grinning as if he was daring him to follow.</p>

<p>"Yea right." Sy said, but before he knew it the sand underneath his feet softened very suddenly, and sucked him in. Sy barely had time to react. He fell through a thick layer of sand and then down into a sort of cave. There were two spots of light, the one from where he fell, and another where the boy had sunk. He could see him there, standing ahead, just the end of his barefeet immersed in the light. A larger form stepped in behind him. A set of white eyes and a larger pair of legs swung over the boy and stepped into the light.</p>

<p>He was broad shouldered with a matching chest and shoulder long, straight, red hair. He shot towards him like a bullet, his arm pushing forward and grabbing both the base of his chin and the most of his neck with his large hand. He slammed him back hard against a stone wall, cracks forming from under him. Sy's eyes widened as he found himself pinned to the wall by an angry giant.</p>

<p>Then the demon spoke aloud and clear. "Well well well. Nemerald's little lapdog comes for a visit. If your life was in danger, would he save you?"</p>

<p>"Probly not..." Sy admitted. "Christ. I'm stayin' there cause it's convenient and cause it means I can eat. We're not fucking family, I don't give two shits about him."</p>

<p>Vincent appeard intrigued. "Is that so? Then why not get help us get rid of him?"</p>

<p>"Why the fuck not, I'm sick of running errands for him."</p>

<p>Vincent let Sy stand back on two feet again, but he kept one of his big hands on his left shoulder.</p>

<p>"Vincent right?" Sy asked, "lots of your buddies got through, but not you, eh? Been a long while, they've all bonded with humans now probly."</p>

<p>"This has been happening for generations... but with the closure of Ayerli'kum it has accelerated. Nemerald shutting the pass is a ruse to weaken us, to reduce us to live pathetic half lives." Vincent said.</p>

<p>"So you wanna go through the pass," Sy said, "I don't care, I'll do whatever, but you've got to give me free reign over this place. No one fucks with me. Ever."</p>

<p>Vincent smirked, "fine."</p>

<p>"Nemerald isn't easy to off though, and there's no way I can get you guys in there... that place is protected. No joke."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've got a way. You'll carry Yess with you," Vincent said, indicating Yess. "Yes, his name is Yess. That's all he ever says, well, all he ever says aloud anyway." Yess had moved out of the corner and was now standing right next to him. "He will do everything," Vincent continued, "all you've got to do is walk in."</p>

<p>"Yea right, even if Yess hides on me Kozi will detect him, won't work."</p>

<p>Vincent stared at Sy for a minute, "Nemerald subdued Oss. What a shame."</p>

<p>"Only way he'd let me stay." Sy replied. "About Oss being in here, feelin' kinda crowded already... ain't that a problem?"</p>

<p>"This is an exciting day," Vincent said with a toothy grin, "this has never been done. If we won't try, we won't know."</p>

<p>"Wait, this could kill me," Sy said, trying to back away, but the wall was right there. Vincent's hand was also keeping him anchored to the spot where he stood.</p>

<p>Yess approached Sy, and his body turned into a tar-like liquid. Vincent held Sy hard then, "say ah..."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Sy protested.</p>

<p>Yess splashed onto him, then began to enter his body anyway he could, through his mouth, and nostrils. Sy couldn't scream, the liquid was thick in his throat. He was choking, couldn't breathe. Then it was over, he felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then in his chest, and then... nothing.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Nemerald was looking over some documents when Sy returned. "How was the view today?" he asked, like he did everyday. "Anything to report?"</p>

<p>"Yea. You want to hear it now, or later?" Sy said. He walked near Nemerald, eyeing him carefully and looked around. Jak wasn't in the room. Good, Sy thought.</p>

<p>"I've got some time now. I'm listening," Nemerald said. </p>

<p>Sy stepped near him. He was pale, sweaty, he gripped Nemerald's shoulder then and began spitting out black pools of liquid at his feet. Before Nemerald could fully react the pool of blood shot towards him, taking on the shape of black icicles. The black was aiming for his mouth, finding it closed they aimed for his nostrils.</p>

<p>Jak arrived into the room then, seeing what was happening he drew shapes in the air and muttered incantations quickly. A diamond formed around Nemerald and the creature.</p>

<p>Sy was on his knees, coughing, eyes watering, throat burning from the pain of Yess's exit.</p>

<p>The diamond began to pulse rapidly, and with every pulse the black liquid seemed to lift from Nemerald's body, retreating out of his nostrils, ears and mouth. All the while Jak continued to chant and moved his fingers wildly, he then began to shout words until finally Yess lifted from Nemerald's skin and lay fixed on the inner wall of the diamond, it appeared to be boiling, bubbles forming around the surface. The diamond imprisoning Yess lifted away from Nemerald, effectively separating them. Nemerald was breating hard, he turned and spotted Sy then, disapparating.</p>

<p>"Sy! Caliss de traitre!" Jak yelled, he could do nothing. He was too busy trying to contain Yess, and Nemerald did not have time to act either. Sy was gone.</p>

<h3>The promise</h3>

<p>Yesterday.</p>

<p>One evening, teenage Sy and Token were smoking in Circa. They were talking around random things.</p>

<p>"Living's too hard," Token began, taking a quick puff, "all I can think about these days is ending it all."</p>

<p>"Christ," Sy had said. "He ought to die, not you."</p>

<p>"Yea." Token said, completely out of it, "Maybe we ought to kill him."</p>

<p>Sy smirked, "just say when."</p>

<p>Token laughed then, daring to imagine what his life would have been like if his father hadn't been part of it. </p>

<p>"We'll make it look like an accident," Sy continued. </p>

<p>"Not sure I can live with myself, either way..."</p>

<p>"At least you'll get to find out," Sy replied. The thought never left Sy's mind after that.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>One evening after training at the gym, Token arrived home to find his dad lying on the kitchen floor. sSy was in the room, sitting at the kitchen table, reading. He stopped what he was doing when Token stepped in, and stood up.</p>

<p>Token didn't know what to say. He was shocked, paralyzed. "Shit, what did you do..."</p>

<p>"Fucked with his meds," Sy said, "too easy."</p>

<p>"He's dead?" </p>

<p>Sy touched his side with his foot. Luciano was unresponsive, but still breathing, albeit very, very slowly. "Soon. Told him he was gonna die before he collapsed, told him that he ought to not have fucked with you."</p>

<p>Token's heart was racing, he felt like he couldn't breathe. "No, no no..."</p>

<p>"It's over, we've done it," he said as he went over to grab his shoulders, squeezing tightly, "you're free."</p>

<p>"We can't do this..." Token said, unable to stop looking at his father on the floor.</p>

<p>"You wanted him dead, and he's gonna die."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that."</p>

<p>Sy kept calm, keeping a strong hold of his friend to make sure he was paying attention. "He’s subhuman, he deserves it." He took a deep breath. "The beauty of this whole thing, is that people will think he'll have overdosed, happens all the time with opioids. Lots of people make mistakes with dosage, happened to my uncle. You can walk away free, live your life the way you want to. It's that easy."</p>

<p>"Stop saying it's easy!" Token snapped at him, "there's nothing easy about any of this! We can't kill him Sy."</p>

<p>Sy gripped his shoulders even harder. "This needs to happen, you need to be rid of him. You'll never be happy while he's alive."</p>

<p>"I told you, I'm not even sure I'll be happy when he's gone," Token was panicking, his whole body was shaking, "I can't let him die, it's wrong!"</p>

<p>"Aw, you're such a good kid," Sy said with a laugh, "it's okay for shitty people to die Pen."</p>

<p>"You're insane..."</p>

<p>"A little, but this is about your sanity, not mine." Sy released him, and held his hand out.</p>

<p>Token tried to relax, but he couldn't think. The words 'it's wrong to kill' flashed in his mind, he couldn't ignore them. The words were being shouted at him in his head. Token just shook his head. He hurried off and went to the bathroom to get a naxolone kit, he returned and was getting ready to administer it.</p>

<p>Sy looked sad, there was just no convincing him. He gripped Token's collar and began to pull him away.</p>

<p>Token began to shout, he wrenched himself out of his grip but Sy was there to grab him again. Token cursed aloud, he reached up and gripped the front of his shirt, forcing him down on the ground. Token was a lot stronger than Sy and after getting a few punches he was able to free himself.</p>
<p>"You're ruining everything." Sy told him, looking disappointed.</p>

<p>"No! You did that! You ruined it all! I can't lie about this Sy!"</p>

<p>"You've lied about things that are much worse..." Sy paused then.</p>

<p>Token heard voices at the door then. Followed by a quick knock.</p>

<p>"Who the fuck is that?" Sy whispered.</p>

<p>Token began to breathe hard, and suddenly gripped Sy's arm, then reached for him with his other arm and pulled him down on the ground. "Help! I need help now!" Token yelled, turning his head toward the door. </p>

<p>Sy struggled in his grip, screaming, and cursing at him. "You stupid asshole!" Sy yelled. He managed to draw out his knife, a small integral hook on the spine of the blade snagged on the mouth of his pocket, and automatically opened the blade as it cleared it. The knife had a yellow handle. He quickly unfolded it, revealing a serrated, reverse "S" blade with a hawkbill point. "Let me the fuck go!"</p>

<p>The neighbor pushed the door open then, having heard the screaming. </p>

<p>"PLEASE! HELP ME! He hurt my dad! Help me hold him down, he's got a knife!"</p>

<p>Sy cursed aloud. Like an animal caught in a trap, he twisted his body in his grip, hard, and his blade caught Token in the face, the tip ripped through his top and lower lip, splitting it vertically, but even that wasn't enough. Token held on, so Sy drove the serrated blade through his right shoulder so he'd let go. That did it. Token released him. By then the neighbors were inside the house, and were coming towards them.</p>

<p>Sy barely had time to get away, he felt a hand swipping at his clothes, just missing it. One of the men chased after him into the house, while the other went to check after Token. </p>

<p>Token was on the ground, with a bleeding face and shoulder. "I tried to stop him," he stammered, "I couldn't." He closed his eyes, hoping to god they'd catch him. The man looked over his wounds, the gashes on his face and shoulder were evident.</p>
<p>Token would not be fine, never again would he be fine.</p> 

<p>"My dad...!" he said to him, voice shaking.</p>

<p>The man saw the kit on the floor, and knew what to do, he went to assist Luciano straight away, administering the dose. Luciano woke up moments after that. The other man returned then, Sy had gotten away.</p>

<p>The police arrived shortly after. Both Token and his father were taken to the hospital. Token was interrogated about the event. He told them that he arrived home after school to find his father laying on the ground, unresponsive. Sy, his friend, had broken into the house earlier and had messed with his dad's meds, with the goal to kill. Token was going to help his dad, but Sy tried to stop him, then the neighbors came. Sy panicked, stabbed him and ran away.</p>

<p>When asked about why Sy would poison his father, Token replied that Sy was disturbed, jealous. No one had trouble believing that, considering Sy's record. He was antisocial, violent, it was not difficult to believe that he could do something like this. Luciano did not say anything to the police, saying he remembered nothing. </p>

<p>The police searched the city for Sy, and found no one, and to this day no one has ever seen him.</p>

<p>Token then had a renewed fear of his father, uncertain of what he knew. They never spoke about the event.</p>

<h3>The promise</h3>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>Token was sparring at the gym, training for a big fight that was coming. He threw a last punch, "Alright, gonna call it a night, told Mari I'd come back before she was asleep today."</p>

<p>"She ought to come train here too," Troy said."</p>

<p>"She likes where she is," Token replied, "see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Token went to the changing room, gathering his things in a small bag, which he strapped to his back. He stayed in his gym clothes, because he planned to jog home. He put some music in and started to run outside, but then as he ran he felt the world warp, and change around him. Then suddenly, he was in Circa. Token stopped, looking at the green grass, flowers at this feet. He stared at the mountain then. "Shit..."</p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
