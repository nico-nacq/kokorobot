<h3>The promise</h3>

<p>Yesterday.</p>

<p>Token, a tall, athletic yellow-haired boy lay in the grass, bathing under a sun that was not the earth sun. He wore a t-shirt with the words 'flyweight rio 1998'. "Living's too hard," he said aloud, "all I can think about these days is how nice it would be to feel nothing, hear nothing... to just, you know, float in the void."</p>

<p>"This place is sort of like a void," Sy replied, "I get what you mean though." Sy was short and scrawny, with black hair trimmed on the sides and longer at the top, he had blue eyes set under a pair of arched eyebrows, making look perpetually angry. "We don't ever have to leave you know."</p>

<p>"Problem is that when it's quiet, I think too much... and I don't know, seems kind of worse somehow? I feel just as terrible re-living shitty moments in my head. Only way I see out of this is to kill myself, really."</p>

<p>"Come on," Sy had said. "<i>He</i> ought to die, not <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Yea," Token said, completely out of it, "maybe we ought to kill my dad."</p>

<p>Sy smirked, "just say when."</p>

<p>Token laughed then, daring to imagine what his life would have been like if his father, and coach, hadn't been part of it. </p>

<p>"We'll make it look like an accident," Sy continued. </p>

<p>"Naw, not sure I can live with myself either way, so there's no point to it. Whatever I do, I'm fucked." Token said, closing his eyes. "It just hurts. All of it. My body and my thinking thoughts... it shouldn't hurt, but it does."</p>

<p>"At least you'll get to find out if you <i>can</i> live with," Sy replied.</p>

<p>The thought never left Sy's mind after that.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>One evening after training at the gym, Token arrived home to find his dad lying on the kitchen floor. Sy was in the room, sitting at the kitchen table, reading. He stopped what he was doing when Token stepped in, and stood up.</p>

<p>Token didn't know what to say. He was shocked, paralyzed. "Shit, what did you do..?"</p>

<p>"Fucked with his meds," Sy said, "too easy."</p>

<p>"He's dead?" </p>

<p>Sy touched his side with his foot. Luciano, Token's father, was unresponsive but still breathing, albeit very, very slowly. "Soon."</p>

<p>Token's heart was racing, he felt like he couldn't breathe. "No, no no..."</p>

<p>"It's over, we've done it," he said as he went over to grab Token's shoulders, squeezing tightly, "you're free."</p>

<p>"We can't do this..." Token said, unable to stop looking at his father on the floor.</p>

<p>"You wanted him dead, and now he's gonna die."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that."</p>

<p>Sy kept calm, keeping a strong hold of his friend to make sure he was paying attention. "He’s subhuman, he deserves it." He took a deep breath. "The beauty of this whole thing, is that people will think he'll have overdosed, happens all the time with opioids. Lots of people make mistakes with dosage, happened to my uncle. You can walk away free, live your life the way you want to. It's that easy."</p>

<p>"Stop saying it's easy!" Token snapped at him, "there's nothing easy about any of this! We can't kill him Sy."</p>

<p>Sy gripped his shoulders even harder. "This needs to happen, you need to be rid of him. You'll never be happy while he's alive."</p>

<p>Token was panicking, his whole body was shaking, "I can't let him die, it's wrong!"</p>

<p>"It's okay for shitty people to die Pen."</p>

<p>"You're insane..."</p>

<p>"A little, but this is about <i>your</i> sanity, not mine." Sy released him, and held his hand out.</p>

<p>Token tried to relax, but he couldn't think. The words 'it's wrong to kill' flashed in his mind, he couldn't ignore them. The words were being shouted at him in his head. Token just shook his head. He hurried off and went to the bathroom to get a naxolone kit, he returned and was getting ready to administer it.</p>

<p>Sy looked sad, there was just no convincing him. He gripped Token's collar and began to pull him away.</p>

<p>Token began to shout, he wrenched himself out of his grip but Sy was there to grab him again. Token cursed aloud, he reached up and gripped the front of his shirt, forcing him down on the ground. Token was a young boxing champion, much stronger than Sy, and after getting a few hits he was able to free himself.</p>

<p>"You're ruining everything," Sy told him.</p>

<p>"No! You did that! You ruined it all! I can't lie about this Sy!"</p>

<p>"You've lied about things that are <i>much</i> worse!" Sy told him, eyeing his unconscious father on the floor.</p>

<p>Token heard voices at the door then. Followed by a quick knock.</p>

<p>"Who the fuck is that?" Sy whispered.</p>

<p>Token began to breathe hard, and suddenly gripped Sy's arm, then reached for him with his other arm and pulled him down on the ground. "Help! I need help <i>now</i>!" Token yelled, turning his head toward the door.</p>

<p>Sy struggled in his grip, cursing at him. "The fuck are you doing?!" No matter what he did, he couldn't get Token to release him.</p>

<p>The neighbor pushed the door open then, having heard the screaming. Sy heard, and started beating into Token, determined to run away. "If you don't let go right now I'll hurt you!" Sy whispered.</p>

<p>"Help!" Token screamed again.</p>

<p>Sy managed to draw out his knife, a small integral hook on the spine of the blade snagged on the mouth of his pocket, and automatically opened the blade as it cleared it. The knife had a yellow handle. He quickly unfolded it, revealing a serrated, reverse "S" blade with a hawkbill point.

<p>"He hurt my dad! Help me hold him down! He's got a knife!" Token shouted.</p>

<p>Sy cursed aloud. He twisted his body in his grip, hard, and his blade caught Token in the face, the tip ripped through his top and lower lip, splitting it vertically, but even that wasn't enough. Token held on, so Sy drove the serrated blade through his right shoulder so he'd let go. That did it. Token released him. By then the neighbors were inside the house, and were coming towards them.</p>

<p>Sy barely had time to get away, he felt a hand swipping at his clothes, just missing it. One of the men chased after him into the house, while the other went to check after Token.</p>

<p>Token was on the ground, with a bleeding face and shoulder. "I tried to stop him," he stammered, "I couldn't." He closed his eyes, hoping to god they'd catch him. The man looked over his wounds, the gashes on his face and shoulder were evident. "You're going to be fine," the man told him.</p>

<p>Token would not be fine, never again would he be fine.</p> 

<p>"My dad...!" he said to him, voice shaking.</p>

<p>The man saw the kit on the floor, and knew what to do, he went to assist Luciano straight away, administering the dose. Luciano woke up moments after that. The other man returned then, Sy had gotten away.</p>

<p>The police arrived shortly after. Both Token and his father were taken to the hospital. Token was interrogated about the event. He told them that he arrived home after school to find his father laying on the ground, unresponsive. Sy, his friend, had broken into the house earlier and had messed with his dad's meds, with the goal to kill. Token was going to help his dad, but Sy tried to stop him, then the neighbors came. Sy panicked, stabbed him and ran away.</p>

<p>When asked about why Sy would poison his father, Token replied that Sy was disturbed. No one had trouble believing that. Sy was antisocial, and violent. Luciano did not say anything to the police, saying he remembered nothing.</p>

<p>The police searched the city for Sy, and found no one, and to this day no one has ever seen him...</p>

<h3>Tar boy</h3>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>A 25 year old Sy was atop a mountain, sitting and watching the world around him. The place vast and green and devoid of anyone like him. The thick forests only concealed spirits and demons. Sy wore tattered jeans, and a black t-shirt, clothes that he wore again, and again, as if the aim was to have them dissolve on his body.<p>

<p>Today Sy was feeling restless, he could feel it in his skin and in his bones. He knew the mountain area by heart, and today he decided to leave it. Sy began to walk down the mountain side, and a few hours later he reached the bottom. The air felt electric here. He stared up and around, then took a step forward and felt the hairs on his head and arms raise as he walked through the invisible barrier protecting the mountain. He walked until he reached the tree line and went through.</p>

<p>After a while he arrived in a small cleaning in the forest. Sy bent down and laid a hand over a spot in the ground, he could no longer see it, but he knew that's where the symbol had been. Burn scars healed over quickly. Sy began gathering some small rocks, and drew the pattern on the forest floor again, overlaid over the old pattern perfectly. A rock marker would not disappear with time.</p>

<p>The air smelled of pines and wet wood, but then suddenly Sy detected a sour, burnt smell. Then he realized that the smell was not a what, but a who...</p>

<p>A boy stood in front of him, grinning. His lips were bright red, and his eyes were closed, sealed shut. His skin appeared dry, cracked.</p>

<p>Sy stared, "you reek..." he said with an amused look on his face.</p>

<p>"Yessss," the boy said.</p>

<p>Sy laughed, as if he'd expected the boy to say exactly this. "Yea yea, I'm ready. And you?" Sy said.</p>

<p>"Yessss..." the boy said again. The boy turned around and walked off then. Yess only ever said yess, making it easy to trick him into saying things. Some would tire of this game, but not Sy.</p>

<p>"Sy followed him. They exited the woods and arrived in a long yellow desert. The transition from green to yellow was incredibly abrupt. Sy saw the boy at the top of a mound ahead, and then saw him as he began to sink into the ground, facing Sy, grinning as if he was daring him to follow.</p>

<p>The sand underneath Sy's feet softened very suddenly, and sucked him in. Sy barely had time to react. He fell through a thick layer of sand and then down into a sort of cave. There were two spots of light, the one from where he fell, and another where the boy had sunk. He could see him there, standing ahead, just the end of his barefeet immersed in the light. A larger form stepped in behind him. A set of white eyes and a larger pair of legs swung over the boy and stepped into the light.</p>

<p>"I'm tired," Sy said.</p>

<p>The tall demon was broad shouldered with a matching chest and shoulder long, straight, red hair. "Good. Today's the day then."</p>

<p>"Why the fuck not, I'm sick of running errands for him..."</p>

<p>"All you've got to do is walk in," Vincent said.</p>

<p>"As I've told you before, I don't care, I'll do whatever, but you've got to give me free reign over this place. No one fucks with me. Ever."</p>

<p>"Sure, whatever you want," Vincent said with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>"So what happens next?"</p>

<p>Yess approached Sy, and his body turned into a tar-like liquid. Yess splashed onto him, then began to enter his body anyway he could, through his mouth, and nostrils. Sy couldn't scream, the liquid was thick in his throat. He was choking, couldn't breathe. Then it was over, he felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then in his chest, and then... nothing. Sy laughed, "christ, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Happy hunting," Vincent said.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Sy walked past the outside barrier, and returned to Nemerald's lab, built on the inside of a mountain. The rock walls had been smoothed down, and several rooms had been carved in. Light entered the space from above, through a deep chasm dug into the mountain top. Hard glass separated the outside from the inside. Furniture had been built from wood, cut from trees in the area, although some items did not come from this world... things like high tech medical equipment, and computers.</p>

<p>Nemerald was looking over some documents when Sy returned to the lab. "How was the view today?" he asked, like he did everyday. "Anything to report?" Nemerald was 36 years old, grey-haired, and purple-eyed. He was of short stature, with a thick build. He wore glasses, but Sy knew, did not need them. Nemerald had once said that he found comfort in wearing them, he enjoyed their weight on his nose.</p>

<p>"Yea. You want to hear it now, or later?" Sy said. He walked near Nemerald, eyeing him carefully and looked around. Jak wasn't in the room. Good, Sy thought.</p>

<p>"I've got some time. I'm listening," Nemerald said. </p>

<p>Sy stepped near him. Then he felt his body aching again, the surge of pain was so intense that he blacked out.</p>

<h3>The promise</h3>

<p>Today.</p>

<p>Token was sparring at the gym, training for a big fight that was coming. He threw a last punch, "Alright, gonna call it a night, told Mari I'd come back before she was asleep today."</p>

<p>"She ought to come train here too," Troy said."</p>

<p>"Naw, she likes where she is," Token replied, "see you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Token went to the changing room, gathering his things in a small bag, which he strapped to his back. He stayed in his gym clothes, because he planned to jog home. He put some music in and started to run outside, but then as he ran he felt the world warp, and change around him. Then suddenly, he was in Circa. Token stopped, looking at the green grass, flowers at this feet. He stared at the mountain then. "Shit..."</p>

<p>Token walked to the long tunnel leading to Nemerald's lab inside the mountain, reaching the door he knocked three times, and then knocked twice real fast. The door opened and he stepped inside to find that the main room was completely destroyed. Token had not been here in a long, long while. "Nemerald?" he called out.</p>

<p>Jak came walking out of a back room, and waved him over. Jak was a lanky demon, with grey skin and short black hair. His eyes were large and round, with yellowed whites and large black pupils. He too appeared to have suffered in the fight, his white shirt had soaked up a lot of his own blood. His forearms were covered in strange symbols and markings.</p>

<p>Token did not want to be here at all. He sighed as he pushed through the mess of broken furniture... "shit, is that blood?" he mumbled, walking past a red stain on the ground. He arrived into the back room, walked past Jak and saw Nemerald laying on a table on his back. Nemerald was terribly pale, the area around his neck was bruised and the area near and around it, his upper torso and left shoulders were covered in heavy gauze. Nemerald turned to look at Token then, one of his eyes was red with blood, his cheek was purple and made his face appear much wider than it was. "What happened?" Token asked.</p>

<p>"Sy happened..." Jak said, with a discernible French accent.</p>

<p>Token closed his eyes. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Hakum'wi," Jak replied, "time to pay your dette."</p>

<h3>Montore</h3>

<p>Sy woke up in a forest, although it was less lush, and there was debris everywhere, garbage, discarded electronics and cans of beers. The forest was thinner here than it used to be, Sy could see a parking lot. A mega store stood not far from it. It was early in the morning, it was closed with no one around.</p>

<p>For a moment he tried to piece together what had happened, "did I kill him?" he asked himself. Then he felt something burning inside and he could feel it, it might have been Yess, or some pain from the fight, either way, he knew their plan had failed. Sy sighed, "barred from two worlds..." he said aloud, "gatta stop losing fights." He had not yet noticed, but he was bleeding from his forehead, and his knuckles too were blood red.</p>

<p>It was likely that no one would recognize him after being away for 7 years, but he didn't want to risk it. When it got dark, he left the forest to wander the streets of Montore.</p>

<p>Sy had been carrying his old wallet with him this entire time, he found a few dollars in it. The first thing he did was try and get a drink at a bar. He took a seat at the bar, but appeared uncomfortable, unaccustomed to a room full of people. He was annoyed, and people were loud, but it was warm. He stared at the drink menu, "what the fuck is an IPA..." he whispered. With the menu in hand, he saw the red on his knuckles "shit..." he quickly used the inside of his sleeves to wipe it up. In this moment, Sy was glad to be wearing a black t-shirt, he suspected that a white shirt would reveal many more traces of blood. "Not my blood..." he muttered, after inspecting himself and finding no wounds. "So if he's dead... I can go back? But no no no... then I would have stayed there. Fuck. What the fuck happened?" he said to himself, this conversation occuring in his head.</p>

<p>"Got some ID?" a bartender asked.</p>

<p>Sy looked up, coming face to face with a spirit. It's body was long, orange and was covered in scales from the neck down.</p>

<p>"No. Give me one of those fake German beers..." he said. The bartender nodded and re-appeared with the non-alcoholic drink, popping off the cap for him. "Glass?"</p>

<p>"Fine like this," Sy said.</p>

<p>"7.50," Galeru the bartender called, presenting two open hands. Sy noted that the spirit had 6 limbs.</p>

<p>"What? For a beer? Christ. Fucking inflation..." Sy had exactly thirty dollars in this pocket. He gave him a 10$ bill. "Give me back a dollar." He then found some peanuts on the bar top and dumped the entire bowl in his hand and then transfered it all to his mouth. "These are free right?" he asked, hoping to god they were.</p>

<p>The bartender floated away, its large tail twisting as he went to grab some change from the register. Sy noticed a blonde boy working the bar, "no fucking way..." Sy said, eyeing him carefully.</p>

<p>Galeru returned, handing Sy a single golden coin.</p>

<p>"So that one with the crop top and shorts over there, his name's Orion right?"</p>

<p>Galeru eyed Sy suspiciously then, "maybe, who's asking?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Well, ima save you time and pain Nowan. You're not his type," Galeru said, eyeing Sy up and down before floating away.</p>

<p>"I wasn't-ah fuck it to hell..." He sighed,s then took a sip of his drink, eating more peanuts between sips. He noticed the spirit flying away to serve customers at the other end of the bar, but then frowned when he saw him whispering to Orion. Orion looked over, but Sy was already gone. He'd ducked out of sight and had gone to hide behind a group of people in the back, taking the bowl of peanuts and his beer along.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>After his beer, Sy spent the night outside. He found a secluded spot in a nearby park. He kept watch for a while, but eventually fell asleep. He woke up the next morning with a start, someone was standing over him and poking him with a bottle. "Water Mister Cross?" Orion offered him. Sy jumped a little at the sight of him, and couldn't understand why he was trying to give him water but without really thinking he grabbed it and took a swig. Though when the liquid hit his mouth he spat it out coughing.</p>

<p>Orion laughed, "Vodka. Sorry, terrible joke to make. You looked like you needed a drink drink."</p>

<p>Sy looked up at him, "how'd you find me..."</p>

<p>"Galeru's got a good nose, and good eyes... you were familiar to him, so he followed it here and came back to tell me about it." Orion explained. "Listen. If you want food and a warm place to stay, come to 183 Dudein road at midnight tonight. Sorry for the late hour, I've got some errands to run today and I'm working tonight but my shift ends at eleven. Walk around the building there's a back entrance. Knock 4 times, I'll come and get you. Then we'll talk, drink, fuck..." saying this, Orion winked in a jokey-kind-of-way, then he left.</p>

<p>~</p>

<p>Later that night, Sy showed up at the back of Orion's building. "Is this a shit idea...?" he asked himself, under his breath. He hesitated to knock. Before he could, he was pushed face first into the door, body flat up against it. "Don't move, and keep your mouth shut," the voice behind him ordered. Sy of course had no desire to be caught, he pushed back and tried to get free of this guy but couldn't. Before he knew it he was on his knees, face against the door still and someone was binding his hands together behind his back. Sy couldn't yell for help, who comes to the aid of a wanted man? He even had his mouth bound up with a piece of tape.</p>

<p>The door opened finally and he was pushed inside, dragged around in the dark and past a few more doors. Then he was thrown onto something soft, a couch. He could hear people bickering in the dark, shadows moved around him. He waited, sitting on the couch, someone would talk to him eventually.</p>

<p>"You hungry?" someone squeaked at him, then he heard shuffling and cursing.</p>

<p>"If he's hungry? For fuck's sake!" the other person whispered.</p>

<p>"Well what are we supposed to do now? Just whisper in the dark like idiots? He knows I live here."</p>

<p>The other person sighed. "Fine."</p>

<p>A light flicked open, a small lamp just beside where he was sitting and the person lighting it was, of course, Orion. "Hey!" He said, with a guilty smirk.</p>

<p>Sy could see there was someone else there, standing further in the back in the dark. He didn't seem to want to come closer, he just paced around wildly, from the living room to the kitchen and back.</p>

<p>"So, are you hungry?" Orion asked Sy.</p>

<p>Sy nodded, eager to have that tape off his lips.</p>

<p>"I'll get you a plate of something," Orion said.</p>

<p>He re-heating some curry and rice on the stovetop. Soon, the smell enveloped the room, escaping into the living room. Sy's stomach rumbled loudly, he hadn't eaten any real food in days. Once the food was warm, Orion transfered it to a bowl and returned to the living room with the meal. He set the curry down on the coffee table, and took a seat next to Sy. </p>

<p>"Sorry about that, we didn't know how you'd react," Orion said, peeling the tape off. Before Sy could speak, he brought a spoonful of curry near his mouth, "this is how it's going to be for now," he said apologetically.</p>

<p>Sy shrugged, he was starving and tired and was in no mood to fight. He took a first bite. This was the first warm, and aromatic meal he'd had since leaving the real world. The experience was so intense that he had to stop in mid-chew. He hadn't eaten food like this in ages, all Nemerald served were something he called 'nutri-blocks'. The food was always the same, dry, bland and full of nutrients, or so he said. Sy hated mealtime, so much that he'd lost a ton of weight over the years. Eating had become a chore. Sy wasn't a food connoisseur, but he missed the experience of food, of being able to detect subtleties in a meal, to have flavor come at you in waves. He chewed, paused, and swallowed, spoonful after spoonful until the bowl was empty. </p>

<p>"Is there more?" He asked. </p>

<p>Orion smiled, "that was a leftover, so no, but I can make something else." He got up and went into the kitchen to see what he could make real fast. "How about grilled cashew cheese? That's all I got, we don't eat dairy here. Trust me though, it's real good." Sy was salivating at the thought of it. "I'm good with anything."</p>

<p>"What did you eat in Circa anyway?" Orion asked.</p>

<p>Sy glanced over at the dark silhouette by the window, he stopped pacing but stood there, staring outside. "Just dry stuff," he said. "Got any soda? Aching for something fizzy and sweet." Sy asked, eager to stop talking his life in Circa.</p>

<p>Orion poked his head out of the kitchen holding an orange soda, "yep!"</p> 

<p>The silhouette darted from his spot near the window and tore the can from Orion's hands, and without warning, he tossed it over to Sy. The can hit the wall just a few inches from his head and exploded, the orange soda came shooting out and sprayed Sy in the back of the head.</p>

<p>"He doesn't get any more treats," the silhouette said.</p>

<p>Sy stood up, his neck sticky with soda. “Damn. What a sad, sad waste." Since his hands were bound, he couldn't wipe it off. He made a face as it streamed down his back, entering the back of his pants. "Gross." </p>

<p>Token finally emerged from the shadows. There he was, his childhood friend, the boy who he'd last seen on the ground. He was very tall now, with wide shoulders and a thin waist. Token had an athletic build, with well-toned arms and legs. His hair was the same, spiky and blonde. He bore a scar on his lip, a thin line that traversed both the top and bottom lip. He had listless eyes, the rest of him appeared strong and confident.</p>

<p>"Oh I've been waiting a long time for this," Sy said, "is this why I'm tied up? You're going to turn me in to the authorities or something? You're going to give me what I deserve?"</p>

<p>Images of himself covered in blood flooded into his mind. Token remembered being on the ground, bleeding next to his unconcious father. It felt like it lasted a lot longer than it did. He remembered being interrogated by policemen.</p>

<p>"So, what you gonna do with me?" Sy asked.</p>

<p>Orion looked at Token, wondering the same thing.</p>

<p>"You had no right... fucking with my life like that," Token said, scornfully.</p>

<p>"Your life was already irreparably fucked with," Sy spat, "I was tryin' to help. You needed it."</p>

<p>Token's face was red with anger, he rushed for Sy and pushed him up against a wall.</p>

<p>"Oh fuck you, you're the asshole. You just couldn't let me get away eh? Even after I did all the work..." Sy said, then looking at Token's expression he deduced that not much had changed since their time. "He's still coaching you isn't he? That's sick. Do you really hate yourself that much?"</p>

<p>Orion tried to stop him, but Token shoved him away, then he began to throw punch, after punch. All of his pent up rage, his fear and his sadness came spilling out. Token punched so hard and so much that Orion had to squeeze himself inbetween to get him to stop, and that worked well ennough. Token would never lay a hand on his brother.</p>

<p>"Breathe," Orion said as he held his shoulders. "Sit, way waaaay over there, and breathe, 3 seconds, hold your breath, 3 seconds, exhale." He walked his brother over to a couch opposite to where Sy had been. Token was breathing heavily, but he was beginning to calm down.</p>

<p>Sy was in a sorry state, sitting on the floor, eyeing Token. He stayed silent, knowing that anything could set him off again. </p>

<p>Orion felt like the only adult in the room, he hated feeling that way. He went over to Sy and undid his cuffs, carefully. "I'm taking him to the bedroom," he told Token. He helped Sy up. "Can you stand?" he asked him. </p>

<p>“Yea, yea,” Sy said, getting up. He walked him to his bedroom, and laid out a sheet over it to keep the blood stains off and then helped Sy onto it. </p>

<p>“Lie down,” Orion said, he then left and returned with some painkillers, “and take 2 of these, every 4 hours. I’ll get you some water.” Token had tons of meds, in his line of work these were indispensable. Orion also brought some cold compresses for his bruises. He helped Sy out of his shirt and began to inspect his wounds, to make sure nothing was broken. "Shit," Orion said, his finger near his left clavicle, "you've got a broken clavicle, I think. Bone hasn't broken through the skin though."</p> 

<p>"Great," Sy said.</p>

<p>Orion knew he couldn't take Sy to a hospital, Sy had no form of ID of any kind and it was too much of a risk. "I've got some training, did a first-aid course for my work," Orion said, "drunk people do really stupid shit." When Sy tried to move Orion shook his head. "You'll have to lie here awhile, try not to lift your left arm." A little while later the pills began to take effect, and Sy went to sleep. Orion washed some of the red from his face while he slept, cleaning up some of the wounds as well.</p>

<p>"You went too far," Orion told his brother, moving back into the living room. Token hadn't moved all this time, he just sat there, focusing on his breathing with his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Token opened his eyes, "I hate him... so, so much," he said.</p>

<p>"Now you're even."</p>

<p>"Not even close," Token said, through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>"Be glad I ran into him out there, cause I think he was trying to find you." Orion sighed, not certain how he was able to keep calm in this moment. A violent man lay in his bed, and before him stood a ticking time bomb. "Oof..." Orion said, fanning himself, trying to think on what to do next.</p>

<p>"Why the fuck are you being so kind to him?" Token spat out then, he was so angry he appeared deranged.</p>

<p>"Did you see how terrible he looks? He's super skinny, pale... I think the years he spent away were punishment enough,” Orion had seen scars on Sy's arms, perhaps things were worse than he'd first let on. "And you know, I don't want to set him off. He's in our appartment, I'm sure I don't have to remind you." Orion glanced at Token then, "how do you think we should handle this? Police?"</p>

<p>Token shook his head, the very thought of the story coming back into the papers made him anxious "No. Reporters will want to talk to me, and I just can't deal with that kind of shit right now." Token got up then, grabbed his coat and left the appartment. </p>

<p>To be continued...</p>
