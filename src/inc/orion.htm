<hr>
<p>Orion is a club kid, he likes to go out and to get high. He works in a bar in Montore in evenings and is seldom seen alone. He cares about all he meets, even strangers. He is overly kind, but doesn't hesitate to put his foot down if people are openly cruel to others.</p>
<p>Orion is confident and wears whatever, caring little about the opinions of others.</p>
