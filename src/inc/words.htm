<p>Words, expressions....</p>

<ul>
<li>水母の骨, くらげのほね or "Jellyfish bones". And expression to mean something that one would not expect to exist, something exceedingly rare, like jellyfish bones.</li>
<li>Pleurir. A combination of two French words, "pleurer", to cry, and "rire" to laugh. Pleurir means "laugh-cry", which could be interpreted to mean that something is so funny that it makes you cry, or that something is so absurdly sad that it makes you laugh.</li>
<li><b>Mots D'Heures: Gousses, Rames</b>. A French mondegreen (pronounced with a strong French accent) of an English sentence, to say "Mother Goose Rhymes". You really have to master the art of NOT speaking English very well to fully appreciate this.</li>
