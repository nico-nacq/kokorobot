<h3>How to format USB on Linux</h3>
<p>Insert the USB flash drive or SD card into your Linux machine and find the device name using the <b>lsblk -fp</b> command:</p>
<pre>$ lsblk -fp
NAME                            FSTYPE      LABEL       UUID     MOUNTPOINT
/dev/sda
└─/dev/sda1                     LVM2_member             c52... 
  ├─/dev/mapper/mint--vg-root   ext4                    183...   /
  └─/dev/mapper/mint--vg-swap_1 swap                    337...   [SWAP]
/dev/sdb
└─/dev/sdb1                     vfat        USB Drive   345...   /media/user/usb0</pre>
<p>In the example above, the USB drive is recognized by the operating system as a disk named /dev/sdb with a single partition /dev/sdb1 mounted on /media/user/usb0. Unmount the USB drive if it is mounted:</p>
<pre>sudo umount /media/user/usb0</pre>
<p>Formatting types:</p>
<ul>
	<li>NTFS: The NT File System (NTFS) is the file system that modern Windows versions use by default.</li>
    <li>HFS+: The Hierarchical File System (HFS+) is the file system modern macOS versions use by default.</li>
    <li>APFS: The proprietary Apple file system developed as a replacement for HFS+, with a focus on flash drives, SSDs, and encryption. APFS was released with iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.13, and will become the mandatory file system for those operating systems.</li>
    <li>FAT32: The File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32) was the standard Windows file system before NTFS.</li>
    <li>exFAT: The extended File Allocation Table (exFAT) builds on FAT32 and offers a lightweight system without all the overhead of NTFS.</li>
    <li>EXT 2, 3, & 4: The extended file system (EXT) was the first file system created specifically for the Linux kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>To convert to FAT32, enter desired label name (optional):</p>
<pre>$ sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdb1 -n "USB Drive"</pre>
