<p>British Columbia is home to many wonderful mushrooms. Vancouver Island in particular, is a great location for learning about and foraging mushrooms. I made this series to learn about local varieties, and also because I love getting lost into their details.</p>

<p>I started this series in December 2021.</p>

<p>Each drawing are 148x210mm (6x8inches) ink drawings. I will put them up for sale in the {store} once the series is complete.</p>
