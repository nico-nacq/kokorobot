  <p>Pino has been home to me and my partner <a href='https://xxiivv.com'>Devine</a> since 2016. We have traveled around the south and north Pacific together, and experienced many great and difficult things.</p>
  <p>My sailboat is a Japanese boat. It was manufactured in Shizuoka and put together in the Pacific Northwest. It is a simple boat, with simple systems. Pino has no refrigeration, no hot water or water pressure, and a minimum of high-power devices.</p>
