<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>A short post to make it clear where I stand as a person, and with my work.</p>

<p>I am <b>committed</b> to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>

<p>I am <b>aggressively</b> opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds.</p>

<p>Some of the wording borrowed from the fantastic <a href='https://blood-and-dust.com/politics/' target='_blank'>Blood and Dust</a> project.</p>
