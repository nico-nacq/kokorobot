<h3>Spritesheet conversion to GIF</h3>

<p>ImageMagick can convert spritesheets to gif animations, here is the recipe I used:</p>

<pre>convert -dispose 3 -delay 20 -loop 0 input.png -crop 64x64 +repage output.gif</pre>

<p>Here is a breakdown of the recipe:</p>

<p><b>-dispose 3</b> 'dispose" defines the way the displayed image is modified after the current frame of an animation has gone past, and before another frame is overlaid.<br />
<b>3</b> refers to 'previous', which clears to the image prior to the current frame's overlay.<br /> 
<b>-delay 20</b> displays the next image after pausing for a number of seconds.<br />
<b>-loop 0</b> set to zero the animation repeats an infinite number of times.<br />
<b>input.png</b> is my starting spritesheet.<br />
<b>-crop</b> cuts out one or more rectangular regions of my image to 64x64 pixels. For my animation, I had 5 frames, 64 is the width/height of the bounding box of the sprite (full width 320px / 5).<br />
<b>+repage</b> adjusts the canvas and offset information of the image.<br />
<b>output.gif</b> is the resulting, assembled gif image.</p>
