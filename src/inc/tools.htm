<p>Because I don't always have a lot of power available on the boat I have a two workstations, one for regular use and the other for low-power situations.</p>

<p>I draw by hand a lot, and digitize the drawings by photographing them (I don't own a scanner) and cleaning them up in Gimp (threshold). Most of my art nowadays are line drawings, which take up less space, and are easier to process with simple tools. I like to dither (using <a href='https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder' target="_blank">didder</a>) my art to save space, but also because I like the look.</p>

<h3>Low-power workstation</h3>

    <p>I use <b>Obi</b>, a Macbook Air 2013, it presently runs the community version of Manjaro(i3), the laptop was donated to <a href='https://100r.co'>Hundred Rabbits</a> by <a href='https://www.instagram.com/roamingforlife/' target='_blank'>Lloyd Williams</a>. This computer draws 45w per hour.</p>

    <p>When I have access to shore power, I use <b>Vincent</b>, an old 2010 Macbook Pro with the <a href="https://elementary.io/" target="_blank">ElementaryOS</a> Linux operating system, a generous donation by my friend John Eternal.</p>

    <p>It draws more power than Obi, and the battery is mostly dead (it has 5 minutes of power independence). I've replaced the battery twice, the first one was a third-party battery and it lasted a year, the second was an ifixit battery and its performance has also died quick.</p>
