<p>Because I don't always have a lot of power available on the boat I have a two workstations, one for regular usage and the other for low-power situations.</p>

<p>I draw by hand a lot, and digitize the drawings by photographing them (I don't own a scanner) and cleaning them up in Gimp (threshold). Most of my art nowadays are line drawings, which take up less space, and are easier to process with simple tools. I like to dither (using <a href='https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder' target="_blank">didder</a>) my art to save space, but also because I like the look.</p>

<h3>Low-power workstation</h3>

    <p>I use <b>Obi</b>, a Macbook Air 2013, it presently runs the community version of Manjaro(i3), the laptop was donated to <a href='https://100r.co'>Hundred Rabbits</a> by <a href='https://www.instagram.com/roamingforlife/' target='_blank'>Lloyd Williams</a>.</p>

    <p>Accessories:</p>

    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Wacom intuos 4 tablet</li>
        <li>Bluetooth mouse</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I mainly draw on paper, but I also sometimes use an old <b>Ipad 2</b> to draw using Autodesk Sketchbook (no stylus). It isn't the best software ever, not sure I'd recommend it, but I use it since I have it. The Ipad 2's battery lasts a long, long time, and it charges quickly. The goal would be to use Noodle on it too.</p>

    <h3>Regular workstation</h3>

    <p>When I have access to shore power, I use <b>Vincent</b>, an old 2010 Macbook Pro with Manjaro(i3), a generous donation by my friend John Eternal.</p>

    <p>It draws more power than Obi, and the battery is mostly dead (it has 5 minutes of power independence). I've replaced the battery twice, the first one was a third-party battery and it lasted a year, the second was an Ifixit battery and its performance has also died quick.</p>
