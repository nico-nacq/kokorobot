<h3>Questions to start with to find multiple commonalities:</h3>
<p><b>What excites you right now?</b> Gives others ability to give work-related, or more personal answers.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to?<b> Similar to above, but forward-looking than backward-looking, allowing others to choose from a bigger set of possible answers.</p>
<p><b>What’s the best thing that happened to you this year?</b> An open-ended question that gives others a wealth of answers to choose from.</p>
<p><b>Where did you grow up?</b> Less assertive and loaded way than “Where are you from?” Allows them to answer with simple details from childhood or to engage in their story of how they got to where they are right now and what they’re doing.</p>
