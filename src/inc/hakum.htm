    <h2>What is Hakum</h2>
    <p>Hakum is a free-form comic, drawn by hand and published online.</p></columns>
    <p>Hakum follows two Hegata groups: The Solomon's Devils (Solo Devs) and the Ars Goetia, as they fight to protect the Taiga from humans. Both have similar visions of the future, but bicker on how to best build/destroy the road to get there. The story touches on cultural preservation, mental health, and conservancy.</p>

<p>The Solo Devs, led by Kaddali(Kidd) camp out full-time in the Taiga and spend their time sabotaging logging operations and new development. The Ars Goetia, led by Seir, is an organization in Montore which focuses on raising money to buy up land in the Taiga, and to fund social programs for dispossessed Hegatas.</p> 

<p>For now, the comic is non-linear, and I update it sporadically. The comic is drawn by hand, and inked with a dip pen. Shading is done with halftones handmade in Gimp. Because I have to resize the comics for the web, the haftone isn't as apparent (every page is 25% of its original size). Previews below are 50% of the original file size.</p>

<p>See some short sequences I've put together:</p>

<h3>Reunited</h3>

<p>[Finished on October 17th 2022. 7 pages long.]</p>
<p><b>Context</b>: Yegon(formerly, Hakazi) was shot in the eye during a Solo Devs mission in Ren Creek, his group thought him dead. After recovering he was incarcerated in Liskar. Yegon and the Solo Devs crossed paths again 6 years later. This moment is a few months after Yegon is back with the Solo Devs. Kaddali now heads the Solo Devs, and under their leadership the group is doing better than ever. Yegon, on the other hand, feels bitter about what's happened to him, and has difficult accepting the fact that his former group has been thriving without him. Kaddali wants to be closer to Yegon, they still have feelings for him (they were dating prior to the accident), but because of how closed-off and bitter he's become it is not easy. <a href='reunited.html'>Read the comic</a></p>
