    <h2>What is Hakum</h2>
    <p>Hakum is a free-form comic, drawn by hand and published online.</p></columns>
    <p>Hakum follows two Hegata groups: The Solomon's Devils (solo devs) and the Ars Goetia, as they fight to protect the Taiga from humans. Both have similar visions of the future, but bicker on how to best build/destroy the road to get there. The story touches on cultural preservation, mental health, LGBTQ+ relationships, and conservancy.</p>

<p>For now, the comic is non-linear, and I update it sporadically. The comic is drawn by hand, and inked with a dip pen. Shading is done with halftones handmade in Gimp.</p>
