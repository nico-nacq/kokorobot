<h3>Reunited</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. Yegon(formerly, Hakazi) was shot in the eye during a Solo Devs mission to sabotage logging equipment in Ren Creek, his group thought him dead. He did not die, and after recovering he was incarcerated in Liskar for 4 years. He and his friend Ikkard escaped after a fire burned down the building, and both returned to live in Montore. 2 years later, Yegon and the Solo Devs crossed paths again. He and Kaddali were a couple prior to the accident. This moment is a few months after Yegon is back with the Solo Devs. They've been apart for many years. Kaddali now heads the Solo Devs, and under their leadership the group is doing better than ever. Yegon, on the other hand, feels bitter about what's happened to him, and has difficult accepting the fact that his former group has been thriving without him. Kaddali wants to be closer to Yegon, they still have feelings for him, but because of how closed-off and bitter he's become it is not easy...</p>
