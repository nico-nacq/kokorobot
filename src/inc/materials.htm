<li>Indigo — rot proof, flame retardant</li>
<li> Mica (Clay) — Clay pots are the most traditional method for cooking beans and impart an earthy taste. Extremely durable, conducts heat very evenly, and holds heat long after it’s been removed from the flame. The clay itself is alkaline and much of our food is acidic, so when the two combine, it’s possible that we experience a perfectly balanced flavor note. It turns out that a lot of ceramic cooking pots are slightly alkaline, and that alkalinity is what makes bean skins tender—that’s why I typically add a pinch of baking soda when I make beans. But it turns out that bean pots make good beans because there is alkalinity in the clay. https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/i-fail-almost-every-day-an-interview-with-samin-nosrat</li>
