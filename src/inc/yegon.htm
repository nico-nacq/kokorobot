<p>Yegon (Yay-gone) is split between the Ars Goetia and Solomon's Devils.</p>
<p>Yegon used to have another name, Hakazi (Ha-kah-zee, to mean 'growing tree'), but he abandoned it after his time at the Liskar detention center. Before this, Hakazi was part of the Solomon's Devils with <a href="kaddali.html">Kaddali</a>. Together with others, they lived in the Taiga and would go to the neighboring town of Montore to intimidate racist human-led businesses and sabotage logging machinery. Kaddali and he were lovers, they met during protests in Montore and created the Solo D's together.</p>
<p>During a mission he was shot in the head, and his team members thought him dead, but he survived and was incarcerated in Liskar. His experience there robbed him of his confidence, and the abuse/stress transformed his life in a very, very big way.</p>
