<p>Yegon is part of the <b>Ars Goetia</b>, he is one of <a href="seir.html">Seir</a>'s main grunts. He suffers from an impulse control disorder, destroying property and setting fires, an affliction that Seir is more than happy to utilize, at the cost of Yegon's mental health.</p>
<p>Yegon is a trickster, he likes to play games and hates being serious. He is kind, but not all care for his tricks. Yegon is a master at masking his emotions, to the point where many think he's incapable of feeling anything. That couldn't be farther from the truth. When alone, Yegon's demeanor changes, and this is usually the time when his urge to destroy kicks in. He was severely abused as a child.</p>
<p>When very young, he was taken from his home and forced into the Liskar boarding school, the country's way of assimilating hegatas, half-demons, into human society. They cut the tip of his ears off to make him more 'human-like', a barbaric practice common in those days. His otoplasty was evidently botched. Yegon went hungry many nights, he was severely beaten for the slightest infraction, and after many years, he eventually forgot his native tongue.</p>
<p>He had a history of starting fires then too, but the school kept it under control. On his last year there, he lit a fire that quickly spiralled out of control. Fearing for his life, under the cover of flames and smoke, Yegon ran away. In the forest, Yegon met <a href='kaddali.html'>Kaddali</a>. Kaddali had setup camp in the woods to help smuggle children out of the Liskar. Together, they founded the Solomon's Devils, a group that fights against human encroachment on Hegata culture and land. As the group's tactics became more and more extreme, taking human lives, Yegon left to join the Ars Goetia, leaving Kaddali behind.</p>
