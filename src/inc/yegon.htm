<hr>
<p>Yegon is part of the <b>Ars Goetia</b>, he is one of <a href="seir.html">Seir</a>'s main grunts. Yegon's core can generate immense heat, and he dispenses of it through various means, like in the form of steam or fire.</p>
<p>Yegon is a trickster, he likes to play games and has much difficulty being serious. He is a kind creature, but not all care for his tricks.</p>
<p>As a child he was forced into a boarding school to integrate him into human society. They cut the tip of his ears off so he would fit in better, a practice common in those years. Yegon made friends with <a href='kaddali.html'>Kaddali</a> while at this school, and in his 3rd year both escaped the school and founded the Solo Devs, a group that actively fights against human encroachment on Hegata culture and land. As the group's tactics became more and more extreme, taking human lives, Yegon left to join the Ars Goetia, leaving Kaddali to run the organization alone.</p>
