<h3>Disengaging</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. This is during a time before the {Solomons devils} existed, not too long after Kaddali and Hazaki met at a protest against a development project in the Taiga. "Half-lifers", or "Near-deads", are common insults used by hegatas, used towards humans to refer to the fact that they live very short lives, and that they don't matter on the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>

<p><b>Content Warning</b>. <i>Some swearing.</i></p>
