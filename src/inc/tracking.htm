<h3>Tracking</h3>

<p><b>Context</b>. Dae, the ToT (Terror of the Taiga), has recently revealed himself to the Solomon's Devils, to give them a hand so that they can monkeywrench safely. The Solo D's aren't as experienced as Dae, and this worried him. In this sequence, he is teaching its current members, Anuk, Hakazi, Kaddali and Yennifer how to track and counter-track.</p>

<p>I will add sequences that precede and follow this one soon.</p>
