<p><b>April 2023.</b></p>

<p>A lot of updates on this site this month! I added a lot of new pages, but also moved some content around. For instance, there is no more "illustration" section in the header overtop. All of the illustrations previously featured there are now scattered across 3 sections: {games}, {books for children} and {projects}. I put all personal and client games together, and added images of some of the children's books I've worked on since 2008.<br>I have so many backups of projects that I've never listed anywhere, thought it was time to add them to kokorobot. Added some old comics(2009-2010) I've done({pcbc} and {tdc}) in {stories}. They are very silly comics, but I like them. Previously, these comics were all hosted on DeviantArt only. I think it is safer to host these here, I don't really trust websites that offer free hosting of data anymore.</p>
