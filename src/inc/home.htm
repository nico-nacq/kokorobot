<p>22.23.01. Devine & I submitted <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a> to the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam</a>. Yufo likes rock, paper, scissors, and ramen. It's a simple game that you're meant to keep on in the background as you do other tasks. Yufo has a short lifespan, and depending what you give/withhold, and how often, their appearance changes as they age. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>
