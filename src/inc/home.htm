<p>22.05.16. I worked on a little video on image optimization for the Photographer's Gallery as part of their <a href='https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/green-hacks' target='_blank'>Green Hacks video series</a>, the video isn't out yet but I'd encourage you to watch the ones that were already published (they're very good and informative, especially the one on how to install open source software on a camera). Pino and crew have left Victoria Harbor (May 10th) and we are now at anchor, slowly making our way north. Because we have less power I've switched to using <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/tools.html'>Obi</a>, my low-power workstation. I'm also finishing up corrections for <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>
