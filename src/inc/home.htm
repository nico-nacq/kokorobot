<p><b>October 2023</b></p>

<p>I've released the first two pages of the new {Hakum} concept. I'm also testing a new technique. My goal is to use the computer less to make this project, so the frames are drawn and shaded by hand in pencil. I add the text digitally (for now). The new sequence is named {night terror}.</p>

<p>I made two new {wunderland rabbits} images, see the two latest!</p>

<p>I removed a lot of the old CSS of this website, and cleaned up the html to make it more readable. I'm very pleased with the result! It was a long time coming, but I needed a bit of sit-down time (as well as some motivation to do robot work for a day or two). I hope you all like the updates!</p>
