<p>I've released the first two pages of the new <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html" target="_blank">Hakum</a>.</p> concept. I'm also testing a new technique. My goal is to use the computer less to make this project, so the frames are drawn and shaded by hand in pencil. I add the text digitally (for now). The new sequence is named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/night_terror.html" target="_blank">Night Terror</a>.</p>

<p>I made two new <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/wunderland_rabbits.html" target="_blank">wunderland rabbits</a> images. One at the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/wunderland/wunderland.11.full.jpg" target="_blank">botanical garden</a>, the other at a <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/wunderland/wunderland.10.full.jpg" target="_blank">pommeraie</a>.</p>

<p>I removed a lot of the old CSS of this website, and cleaned up the html to make it more readable. I'm very pleased with the result! It was a long time coming, but I needed a bit of sit-down time (as well as some motivation to do robot work for a day or two).</p>

<p>I got <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/cee.html" target="_blank">Cee</a> and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/viktor.html" target="_blank">Viktor</a> tattooed by the amazing <a href="https://ritualdust.com/tattoo/" target="_blank">Lizbeth</a>, see it <a href="https://merveilles.town/@ritualdust/111191488456801990" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
