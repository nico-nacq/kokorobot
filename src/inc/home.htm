<p>Latest projects: added a new <a href="../media/content/project/wunderland/wunderland.9.full.jpg">Wunderland Rabbit pic</a> (see <a href="wunderrabbits.html">Wunderland Rabbits</a>, short comic sequence called <a href="reunited.html">Reunited</a> from the <a href='hakum.html'>Hakum</a> project.</p>

<p>17.10.22. Pino is back in Victoria, to our usual winter spot. Although these days Victoria doesn't feel autumny at all, temperatures are still in the mid 20's and there is still no sign of rain in the forecast (the island as been dry for months). The air is thick with wildfire smoke, so these days we're staying indoors to avoid the worst of it. I found a used CanoScan LiDE 20 scanner in town and I've been scanning art with it for my upcoming free-form comic project <a href="hakum.html">Hakum</a>. For those who followed the project <a href="circa.html">Circa</a>, you'll see that Hakum uses some of the same characters, that is because Circa was a sort of pilot project, a way for me to explore what sort of comic I wanted to do (a way to flesh out the story/characters). Many of the characters have changed, in both appearance/personality (its why I've nuked all the profiles in <a href="character.html">characters</a>, I'll add new ones soon). The story and its focus has changed too! Because it's somewhat different, I've changed the story name. I've a sketchbook-full of art to paste together, something that will occupy much of my time this winter. I've inked, scanned and processed a short segment called <a href="reunited.html">reunited</a>, to see what style to go for. Enjoy. See <a href="updates.html">past updates</a>.</p>
