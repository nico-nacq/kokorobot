<p>Latest projects: illustrations for our <a href='fsftalk.html'>FSF talk</a>, and <a href='vanislandmushroom.html'>Vancouver Island Mushrooms</a>.</p>

<p>22.06.22. The video I worked on about image optimization for the Photographer's Gallery (as part of their <a href='https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/green-hacks' target='_blank'>Green Hacks video series</a>) is out! Watch it <a href='https://youtu.be/cfrB4Gvpj8c' target='_blank'>here</a>. I am currently anchored in Melanie Cove in Desolation Sound. It is quiet here, and we have *some* internet (it is shit though). I have been drawing a lot by hand, more than I have in recent years. I think I needed to have this little trip up north. Having shit internet and little power to use a computer means that I turn to drawing more. It feels great. I've started a short series of drawings for a project about a rabbit and character sailing on a Turnip-shaped boat (see <a href='fsftalk.html'>FSF talk</a>). I came up with the idea when working on the FSF talk, and I want to keep making more! Devine is helping me review <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a> at the moment, I've read it so often that my eyes are completely blind to mistakes (ugh). See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>
