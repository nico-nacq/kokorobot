<p>Latest projects: added a new <a href="../media/content/project/wunderland/wunderland.9.full.jpg">Wunderland Rabbit pic</a> (see <a href="wunderrabbits.html">Wunderland Rabbits</a>, short comic sequence called <a href="reunited.html">Reunited</a> from the <a href='hakum.html'>Hakum</a> project.</p>

<p><b>November</b>. I have finished another comic sequence for <a href='hakum.html'>Hakum</a> called <a href="chase.html">Chase</a>. Because I've had a hard time sticking with comic as a format, I've basically decided to just finish the bits that I like, in the order that I like. It will be weird for others to read, but that's how it's going to be (haha). The story will come together in the right order overtime. Anyway, I've got a good rhythm going on and I am truly in love with inking these comics with a dip pen, it is a game changer for me. I've spent the last few weeks working on some artwork for <a href='https://mindtwisted.com/' target='_blank'>Kanji Study</a>, a Kanji-learning app developed by my good friend Chase Colburn, I'll link the art here once it is released. Enjoy. See <a href="updates.html">past updates</a>.</p>
