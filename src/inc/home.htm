<p>Latest projects: illustrations for our <a href='fsftalk.html'>FSF talk</a>, <a href='vanislandmushroom.html'>Vancouver Island Mushrooms</a>, and a new photo for <a href='wunderrabbits.html'>Wunderlandrabbits</a>.</p>

<p>22.04.03. The video for the FSF talk is out, watch it <a href='https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/software-doldrums/' target='_blank'>here</a>. I was so eager(nervous, rly...) to start talking that I started talking before I was supposed to! Anyway, hope you enjoy it. I drew <a href='../media/content/project/uxn/11.full.jpg'>Varvara on a Sinclair bicycle</a> for Devine. Otherwise, been working on a few commissions, which I will share here soon (they are not yet finished). See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>
