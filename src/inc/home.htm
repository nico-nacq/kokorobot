<p><b>October 2023.</b></p>

<p>I've released the first two pages of the new {Hakum} concept. I'm also testing a new technique. My goal is to use the computer less to make this project, so the frames are drawn and shaded by hand in pencil. I add the text digitally (for now). The new sequence is named {night terror}.</p>

<p>I made two new {wunderland rabbits} images, see the two latest!</p>

<p>Read {update log}.</p>
