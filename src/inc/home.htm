<p>22.02.20. I got my first-aid certification! I've always wanted to have that. As for projects, I've been working on the print copy of <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>, mainly. I am getting better at working with <a href='pandoc.html'>pandoc</a> and LaTeX and I am really pleased with the look of the book so far! I asked for Devine's help to make up a game for the Iridi people, my rough idea was a mix between Domino and Go, and Dev came up with <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/hako.html' target='_blank'>Hako</a>. Dev made sonobe origami boxes and we played it together on the boat! Now we have a new game we can play aboard <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>, and to enrich the world of Wiktopher. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>
