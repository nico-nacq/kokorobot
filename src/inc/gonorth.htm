<h3>Go North</h3>

<p>It was now 0700, and I would have liked nothing better than to just hang out at my place with Mari, a girl I've been seeing for a while. We have fun together, and she understands my situation well enough not to ask too much of me, romantically. This is ideal. I am happy right now, I think. I don't know if this happiness will last, because tonight I agreed to meet with a person I'd been avoiding for many, many years.</p>

<p>His name was Sy Cross.</p>

<p>At one time he'd been a very close friend of mine. In fact, he was the only one who's attitude toward me didn't change when my boxing career took off. Having money changes how others treat you, but it didn't change Sy. He was consistent in that way. When I'd known Sy he was a risk taker, stoic, with few ambitions, but he always did have a taste for trouble. But then something happened to him, something big. He disappeared, returning to Montore a few months later. My brother Orion saw him standing in the middle of centennial park staring up at a statue in silent worship. Something had happened to Sy. The whole idea of meeting him made me very nervous. I wanted to stay happy, and if I wanted to stay happy then I certainly couldn't help Sy with his problems, not right now.</p>

<p>I received a letter from him, a handwritten letterâ€”not something I'm used to getting anymore. In it, he asked to meet me, here. I was surprised. In the letter, he asked that I tell no one. Fine with me, I'm not eager to let others know of my relationship with Sy, I think my sponsors would agree.</p>

<p>Shit, there he is.</p>

<p>"You look well."</p>
<p>"Try honesty."</p>
<p>"Okay, um. You look like shit?</p>
<p>"And I feel like it too."</p>

<p>He chose a restaurant. Good, good. This place doesnt look too dodgy, it's well-lit, and the menus aren't plastic. Actually, that is suspicious for other reasons. I've never seen Sy eat out, or in any normal human setting. Come to think of it, I've never seen Sy drink water... beer maybe, but never water.</p>

<p>"Buy me coffee?"</p>

<p>I did not expect him to be a coffee sort of guy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yea. Sure, it's on me."</p>

<p>Sy doesn't work, and never has money. He doesn't have a cellphone, a car, and as far as i know, he's got no bank account either. I bet that if you looked at the tags at his shirt, that you'd find them blank. Sy, without ties or tags.</p>

<p>We walked inside, taking a seat the nearest table to the entrance. I always do that, as if I need the door close in case I need to leave quickly. It's silly, really. I don't know why I do that. I don't have the kind of life that would require a quick getaway. I sleep on both ears.</p>

<p>"Was wondering if you'd come."</p>
<p>"Yes, well I'm here. Two coffees, black. Thanks."</p>

<p>I waited till the waiter left to continue our conversation, I never like to talk in front of waiters. They always hear parts of conversations, striped of their contexts and I'd rather they not make assumptions on my life.</p>

<p>"For my black, black heart." Sy said aloud, to no one in particular. He then proceeded to picking up a packet of mustard, to use as a fidget. He squeezed the mustard from one end of the packet to the other end, right, left, right left it went, moving the thick blob around with his thumbs.</p>

<P>"Well I got your letter, so... I'm here. What's up. What's going on with you?"</p>
<p>"Bet you'd rather know why I asked you here."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I forgot you hate social niceties. Please don't say not to say sorry."</p>
<p>"Don't say please either."</p>
<p>Sy paused them, his gaze wandering around the room for a moment, as if he was trying to remember how to behave indoors.</p>
<p>"Did you ever wander into the Great Land?"</p>
<p>"The Great Land? That's um, way north isn't it? No roads there as far as I know. Very cold too."</p>
<p>"No roads, no people."</p>

<p>No people huh? I liked to think that Sy thought himself more beast than man.</p>
<p>"You went there. Really. How did you manage that?"</p>
<p>"Bummed a ride with hydroplant workers up to Rocky Point. Walked after, no roads beyond that."</p>
<p>"So you went to the woods. Why did you do that? Didn't peg you for the outdoorsy type."</p>
<p>"I woke up one day feeling real sick. Couldn't eat, or sleep. No matter what I did, this... this sick feeling was there, preying on me, day and night. It got to a point when I couldn't tell when I awake. I had these mad fever dreams. I felt like I was being devoured from the inside, like termites hollowing out wood. I got this crazy idea in my head then, to go north. Just, north. I got the idea, and I went. No one cared or asked what I was doing, no one paid any attention. Everyone's so wrapped up in their lives, commanded by their screens. Anyway, I went north until I got to a place with more trees than people. I hiked up part of the way with a local, said he was going hunting. He told me I was sick, because in the south the land was sick."</p>
<p>"*Are* you sick though?"</p>
<p>"We're all sick. Anyway, he said going north was a good idea. Not that it mattered at that point, I would have gone whether or not he'd said anything. So, we parted ways. I walked into the forest alone. I saw pines, spruces and balsam firs. These trees are amazing by the way. They've adapted to survive long and cold winters. If you look at a needle real close, you'll see they've got no sap, and because they don't they don't freeze. Brilliant. I realized then how terribly adapted we are to this world. We're soft, pink and juicy on the inside, we're made to freeze. The ground under my feet was permanently frozen. It felt hard under my feet. As I walked I stumbled into other places that felt different. My mind was focused on my steps, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I bent down and started digging in the earth, I saw a layer of bedrock just under the soil. Here when it rains the water just drains down into the earth, but because the ground there is either frozen, or made of rock, the water doesn't drain, it stays in the top layers of soil. I saw a lot of these shallow bogs that look like they're solid but they're covered in moss and shortgrass. If you walk on them, the ground feels spongy, and wet. And it's here, that I saw one."</p>
<p>"Saw... one what?" I asked, perplexed, and irritated at the fact he was being willfully vague so that I'd ask. "C'mon... you saw one what?</p>
<p>Sy smirked then. I was a hungry fish in the water, and he was dangling a shiny lure. He knew I would bite, and I knew it too. I let him tease me, and I let him snag me afterward. Enjoy it, you sick bastard.</p>
<p>"I walked up to a large recess in the ground, forming a pool of deep water. A branch was sticking out, it looked like a hand, covered in moss. Curious, I walked close to look at it. Then I slipped and slid halfway into the pool. The water was so cold it hurt. I pulled myself out in a damn hurry. Then, I looked up. The hand had receded into the water, and a head stood in its place. Like, a giant head. You know how in any public park in a city, there's always a bunch of statues of historical figures, but their proportions are stylized, bigger than ours, much bigger. The head in the water was crazy big, bigger than any statue. It was covered in moss and mud, but i could see bits of pale skin underneath. Its eyes were a deep black, like a shark. They were focused on me. I was like, shit, I'm not sure I want this thing's attention."</p>
<p>I was on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>"What the fuck! What was it?"</p>
<p>"You know what, ain't just stories! Those ancient beings, the ones that were here long before the Europeans arrived, and even before the First Nations were there. They exist. I saw one. Anyway, I couldn't move. I was frozen in place, literally. That water was damn cold, and I was tired and I felt sick from before. So i just looked at it, and said... 'hey'"</p>
<p>"You look in the eyes of a being whose existence predates that of our own and you say.. 'hey'."</p>

<p>"What the fuck was I supposed to say? Call me Ishmael? Apologize for the agricultural revolution? I was freezing, and near mad, so that's all I could think of saying. What am I a novelist? I sat there, struck dumb, dumbstruck... whichever, then it rose out of the water, like a pillar. It twisted its neck to look down at me, and it began to speak. What came out instead was an awful gurgle, then water started to come out of its throat, unending. Like a fountain. It cleared its throat, of water, algae, fish, whatever the hell was in there, licked its lips, and said in a clear voice..."English". Its voice was cavernous. It closed its eyes, taking a moment... then it re-opened them again, smiling broadly. Its teeth were discolored. I wasn't really scared up until that point. Like shit, its gonna eat me or something! It's gonna happen, I'm going to be food. It's funny how we think we somehow lie outside the food chain, that we're above every other creature on earth. Being eaten is something that happens to wild animals, not us! We're too smart, we could never be someone else's lunch. I felt real small then, like a rabbit in the clutch of a hawk... well, I imagine that's how a rabbit feels. Then, it just... laughed. It had a croaking sort of laugh. It said: "The ones who move rivers, who have no respect for the trees, nor the birds, nor any other." I was like wait up, I'm not the ambadassor to all humans. As far as im concerned, the birds and I are we're cool. Also, I hate people. I was like, you hate em, i hate em. We agree on that. It looked at me, smiling still. "You came here to die," it said. It ought to have been a question, it scared me that it wasn't. I thought about it for a second, time slowing to a stop as I processed that statement. I came here to die. Did I now? I thought, maybe i did come here for that. Maybe that's what I wanted. Why else would anyone run into the wild and cold, alone, without supplies. As you pointed out before, I like being outside but I know jack shit about surviving there. The giant then moved forward. I felt my heart trying to leap right out of my chest as it slapped it's hand over me. I shit you not, it was as large as my chest. I was pinned down, back wet with moss. Then it neared its face toward me. "We are dust and shadow. Live. There is plenty of time to be dead." It stared at me long after that, looking tired, then it went to lie back down into the pool, closing its eyes. I got up, half forgetting I was frozen, and I walked away. I thought I was gonna die then too, my hands and feet were numb, but next thing I knew, I was wrapped in a heavy coat in the back seat of a car, speeding down the road."</p>
<p>"How is any of that true..."</p>
<p>"Why would I lie."</p>
<p>"So, what, you still feeling sick?"</p>
<p>"Yea, but I'm gonna cultivate it. Like a garden herb."</p>
<p>"That is vague enough to be inoffensive, but knowing you."</p>
<p>Sy smirked then. Turning his attention to his cup of coffee.</p>
<p>We spent an hour talking about regular happenings, but all the while my mind was set on that story, that beautiful lie. In fact, it stayed with me for days. I was infected. At night I found I could only sleep with my head pointing north. My superstition was healthy in the day, but seemed to amplify at night. I'm not certain if I can ever get this out of my mind. Like all who live in the south, I am sick, but I've only just noticed it.</p>
