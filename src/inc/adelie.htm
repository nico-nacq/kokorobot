<hr>
<p>Adélie, or Adé, is a strong Hegata that can take the appearances of others.</p>
<p>She is a genial and kind being. She has much love for humans and is liked by all that she meets. Because she gets to see life through the eyes of many she has grown wise, many turn to her for advice... although she is reluctant to give it.</p>
