<p>22.27.01. <a href='uxn.html'>Uxn</a> is turning a year old tomorrow! SO I made <a href='../media/content/project/uxn/04.full.jpg' target='_blank'>a little illustration</a> to celebrate this. I finally finished adding ALL 137 drawings to the page of my 2012 <a href='hitobito.html'>Hitobito</a> project, the files were previously hosted on Tumblr. We have released 3 new languages for <a href='thousandrooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>: Serbian, Hungarian and Polish. All books are now available as both PDFs and ePUBS. We also re-built the whole project, it was previously written in Ruby and was converted to ANSI C. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>

<p>22.23.01. Devine & I submitted <a href='yufo.html'>Yufo</a> to the <a href='https://itch.io/jam/virtual-pet-jam' target='_blank'>Virtual Pet Jam</a>. Yufo likes rock, paper, scissors, and ramen. It's a simple game that you're meant to keep on in the background as you do other tasks. Yufo has a short lifespan, and depending what you give/withhold, and how often, their appearance changes as they age. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>

<p>22.19.01. I've completed transcribing the Polish, Hungarian and Serbian translations for <a href='thousandrooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a>. I'll add them to out itch.io page soon. I also finished a little <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/illustration/lemorseweb.jpg' target='_blank'>walrus pixel logo</a> for the website <a href='https://lemorse.quebec/' target='_blank'>Le Morse</a>, made in <a href='https://100r.co/site/nasu.html' target='_blank'>Nasu</a>. See <a href='updates.html'>past updates</a>.</p>

<p>22.15.01. I've been working on <a href='thousandrooms.html'>Thousand Rooms</a> this month, adding some new languages like Polish, Hungarian and Serbian. I've also been making text corrections to <a href='wiktopher.html'>Wiktopher</a>. Added project page for <a href='catpot.html'>Catpot</a> (older project I still didn't have a page for).</p>
