    <p>I illustrated the cut scenes, game logo and intro, most of the puzzles assets (except some of the backgrounds) as well as the fish and cat. I did not make the UI. I was supposed to do everything, but the production ran long, and by then I had moved west to British Columbia to buy <a href='pino.html'>Pino</a>.</p>
