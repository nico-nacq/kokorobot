<p>Kim runs Sotto Voce almost on her own, due to her mother's advanced age. Kim is relatively easy-going, mostly relaxed, and tries to not burden herself with worry and fear. She is hot-headed at times, and will act without thinking, especially if someone tells her not to do something. In dangerous situations, she can fend for herself all while protecting the ones she cares about.</p>
