<hr>
<p>Kim is relatively easy-going, mostly relaxed, and tries to not burden herself with worry and fear. She is hot-headed at times, and will act without thinking, especially if someone tells her not to do something. In dangerous situations, she can fend for herself all while protecting the ones she cares about.</p>

<p>Kim isn't part of the Ars Goetia but she hangs around with its members. She is close to Seir, although many do not understand why she hangs around him.</p>
