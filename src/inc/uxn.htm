    <h2>Uxn</h2>
    <p>The Uxn ecosystem is a personal computing playground, created to host small tools and games, programmable in its own unique assembly language.</p>
    <p>It was designed with an implementation-first mindset with a focus on creating portable graphical applications, the distribution of Uxn projects is akin to sharing game roms for any classic console emulator.</p>
</columns>

<p>It was designed by <a href='devine.html'>Devine</a> for the <a href='100r.html'>100r</a> projects. The project now has many collaborators and has grown a lot since it's creation.</p>

<p>I make all illustrations related to the project, such as the ones featured in the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html' target='_blank'>documentation</a>. The illustrations are drawn on paper, photographed and processed with <a href='https://www.gimp.org/' target='_blank'>Gimp</a>. The little ox-like creature represents Uxn.</p>

<p>The humanoid character is named <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html' target='_blank'>Varvara</a>. The Varvara computer system was designed with a focus on portability, built on top of the Uxn virtual machine</p>
