<h3><a id='atoms'>Atoms</a></h3>

<p>Atoms have a central core called a <b>nucleus</b>, which is positively charged, and which contains one or more particles called <b>protons</b>. Outside of the nucleus is mostly empty space, but it also houses negatively charged particles called <b>electrons</b>.</p>

<p>A neutral atom has equal positive and negative charge (same quantity of protons and electrons). If an atom gains electrons, it becomes positively charged, and if it loses some, it becomes negatively charged, and it is then referred to as an <b>ion</b>. When an atom loses or gains an electron/proton, this process is called <b>ionization</b>.</p>

<p>If an atom is under stress, say from heat, or by an electrical field, some of the outer shell electrons are dislodged. These are referred to as <b>valence electrons</b>, valence refers to the outer shell populated by electrons.</p>

<p>When current is run through something like a copper wire(a conductor), electrons move from one atom to another. Electric current is basically just <b>a flow of electrons</b> through a conductor.</p>

<h3><a id='current'>Current</a></h3>

<p>Current is measured in <b>Coulomb</b>(abbrev. as C). Note that this unit isn't based on one electron, but rather on a large group of electrons because the charge of a single electron is too small to be practical.</p>

<p>We measure current by the rate that electrons flow through a conductor per second, this is measured in <b>Amperes</b>(abbrev as A).</p>

<p>1 A equals 1 coulomb per second.</p>

<p>The symbol for current is I, appearing on electrical diagrams.</p>

<p>Ex: I = 5A, to say that the current is 5 amperes.</p>

<p>Current is measured with an <b>ammeter</b>, and can be expressed in:<br>Milliamperes (mA, or 1 thousandth of an ampere)<br>Microamperes (µA, a millionth of an ampere).</p>

<p>Current that goes in through a conductor, must come out. There are two ways to look at current flow:</p>

<p><b>Electron current.</b> Where the current flows from negative to positive. Current flow is seen as excess electron entering a conductor, and pushing other electrons ahead of the line until one 'falls out'.</p>
<p><b>Conventional current.</b> Where the current flows from positive to negative. Current flow is seen as an electron falling out at the end of a conductor, leaving a gap, making it so that neighboring electrons all shift one over to allow other electrons to enter at the other end. The gap left by the 'falling' electron makes it that the current flows in the other direction.</p>

<p>Both ways are used, these notes focus on electron current.</p>

<h3><a id='voltage'>Voltage</a></h3>

<p>Electrons on the outer shell(valence) are the ones easiest to move, held in their spot by <b>electrostatic forces</b>. When attempting to charge something, we're pushing electrons, which inevitably will be repelled by electrons that are already there, and by each other. The act of putting a charge to something by adding electrons, that 'effort' is measured in volts (abbrev. as V).</p>

<p>The effort needed to charge an object is a unit of work(a measure of energy transferred by electrons per unit charge), referred to as <b>Potential Difference</b>(abbrev. as p.d). P.D. means modifying a system such that the potential energy at point A is higher than at point B. The magnitude of a potential difference is equal to the work done on a particle if it moves between the two points. The p.d. is measured with a <b>voltmeter</b>, and represented in diagrams as E.</p>

<p>Ex: E = 12 volts</p>

<p>Small voltages are expressed in:<br>millivolts(mV, a thounsandth of a volt)<br>microvolts (µV, a millionth of a volt).</p>

<h3><a id='conductor'>Conductors</a></h3>

<p>Good conductors of electicity includes most metals, and some other materials. That a material is conductive means that it is easier to dislodge its valence electrons.</p>

<p>Good conductors, from best to worse: silver, copper, aluminum, and gold.</p>
<p>Non conductors(insulators): glass, porcelain, rubber, and some plastics.</p>

<p>Copper is the most widely used metal for conductors. Aluminum is used in long distance transmissions. Gold, not being the best metal conductor, is mostly used for its resistance to corrosion. Cost, application, mass and strength determined what metal is best in a particular situation.</p>

<p>Some metals don't conduct as well as others, there is opposition to the flow of electrons, and this creates heat. This reaction is referred to as <b>resistance</b>. Ex: wires in element of a heater. When making radio circuits, this heat is not desirable, there are ways to eliminate the heat that is generated (resistors, see later).</p>

<h3><a id='tolerance'>Tolerance</a></h3>

<p>The values of components in electronics are only approximations. These values only need to be near to the marked value to function in a circuit.</p>

<p>The maximum permissible variation from the stated value is called <b>tolerance</b>. They're written as percentages of the marked value, they can be added or substracted from that value. How much variation depends on the application.</p>

<p>The larger the value of the variance, the lower the tolerance.<br>Ex: a resistor marked as 100 Ω with a tolerance of 10% may have a value of in the range of 100 ± 10%, or 90 Ω through 110 Ω.</p>

<p>Common tolerances are ±20%, ±10%, ±5%, and ±1%.</p>

<h3><a id='resistance'>Resistance</a></h3>

<p>All conductors oppose the flow of electrons to a point, this opposition is referred to as <b>resistance</b>. The unit of resistance is the <b>omh</b>, measured with an <b>ohmmeter</b>. Larger resistances are measured in kilohms and megohms.</p>

<p><b>Ohm's Law</b> refers to how 1 Ω allows 1 ampere to flow when 1 volt is applied to a conductor.</p>

<p>How well a conductor conducts depends on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Resistance</b>. Depends on material.</li>
    <li><b>Length</b>. The resistance increases as the length of the conductor increases.</li>
    <li><b>Diameter</b>. The resistance decreases as the diameter of a conductor increases.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature</b>. The higher the temp, resistance increases and conductivity decreases.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id='resistor'>Resistors</a></h3>

<p>When electrons are forced through a conductor (esp certain metals), the metal is heated, and this is due to the resistance of the wire (not as easy to dislodge valence electrons).</p>

<p>Resistors are rated for a limited amount of heat, if exceeded they can burn up. This limit is measured in <b>W (watts)</b>. The higher the wattage of a resistor, the more heat it can dissipate.</p>

<p>There are 3 kinds of resistors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed resistors</b>. Constant value of resistance.</li>
    <li><b>Tapped resistors</b>. Has taps/connections along the length of the resistance element to divide it into a variety of resistances.</li>
    <li><b>Variable resistors</b>. Has a moving slider/shaft that can change the resistance (like the volume control knob on old radios).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>FIXED RESISTOR</b><br><b>Composition</b>, has a thin film over a ceramic(or heat resisting) core. Carbon doesn't conduct well. The resistance is set by cutting spiral grooves in the carbon (serves to increase length of carbon). Outside is coated with an insulating coat. The coloured bands on a fixed resistor indicate the resistance (there are other types, wont list here).<br><b>Wirewound</b>, Resistance wire is wound around an insulating material with space between the turns of the winding (then covered by an insulating coat).</p>

<p><b>TAPPED RESISTOR</b>, like variable resistors where the slider is stuck.</p>

<p><b>VARIABLE RESISTOR</b><br><b>Wirewound</b>, resistance wire is bound around a porcelain(or other strong insulated core) that can withstand a lot of heat. Contact is made via a slider, with every turn. Resistance can be set and tightened in place.<br><b>Composition</b>, the most common type. The resistive element is baked on, and a 'rolling/wiping' contact traveling over the resistive element produces more or less resistance.</p>

<p><b>Color codes</b>, composition resistors are too small for the resistance to be marked clearly, so instead it is indicated by series of colored bars. Every digit is assigned a color (10 in all).</p>

<pre>
Colour  Value  Tolerance
Black   0      
Brown   1      1%
Red     2      2%
Orange  3
Yellow  4
Green   5      0.5%
Blue    6      0.25%
Violet  7      0.1%
Grey    8
White   9
Silver  0.01   10%
Gold    0.1    5%
</pre>

<p>To remember the code, make up a phrase. In my study material I've encountered: Better Be Ready Or Your Great Ventures Goes West, but I think it best to make up your own. Mine is: Be Better Red, Or You'll Grow Beautiful Violet Grey Wings.</p>

Hello, I am a resistor, and these are my bands.

-----[ |||| ]-----
       ABCD
</pre>

<p>Band order also means something:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Band A</b>: First digit of resistance</li>
    <li><b>Band B</b>: Second digit of resistance</li>
    <li><b>Band C</b>: Multiplier, number of zeroes to add. If 3rd band is gold, multiply the number given by the two first bands by 0.1. If it's silver, multiply the number given by the first two bands by 0.01.</li>
    <li><b>Band D</b>: If present, this gives tolerance of the resistor. If none present, tolerance is ± 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex: 470 Ω with a silver band, meaning it has a tolerance of ± 10%, the tolerance can be as high as 517 Ω, and as low as 423 Ω (470 ± 47, which is 10% of 470).</p>

<h3><a id='conductance'>Conductance</a></h3>

<p>In equations, conductance is abbreviated as G.</p>

<p>If a conductor has <b>high conductance</b>... it has <b>low resistance</b><br>If a conductor has <b>low conductance</b>... it has <b>high resistance</b></p>

<h3><a id='insulator'>Insulators</a></h3>

<p>Materials with such low conductivity that no current can run through them.</p>

<p>They're used to prevent wires from touching anything else (which can alter the current it is carrying).</p>

<h3><a id='magnets'>Magnets</a></h3>

<p>Magnets are used to manipulate current in electronics. The space around a magnet is a <b>magnetic field</b>, with invisible lines of force that flow from North to South, which are used to refer to the two polarities of a magnet (each side). The poles of a magnet repel each other, and opposites attract.</p>

<pre>

        Lines of magnetic force
   |------------------------------|
   |-|--------------------------|-|
   |-|-|-->[S   magnet   N]<--|-|-|
   |-|--------------------------|-|
   |------------------------------|

</pre>

<p>Electric current is made to flow through a conductor by:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Moving a conductor through a magnetic field</li>
    <li>Moving the magnetic field around the conductor</li>
    <li>Moving both the conductor and the magnetic field</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is how generators and alternators work. When the moving conductor is perpendicular to the lines of force of the magnetic field, the electric current is at its max.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of magnets:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Permanent Magnets.</b> One that doesn't change strength physically over time, made from iron, or steel alloys.</li>
    <li><b>Temporary Magnets.</b> Which exist only when maintained by external forces (ex: electromagnet made of soft iron with a coil of wire around it).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id='dc'>Direct Current</a></h3>

<p>With DC current, current flows in one direction only. There are 6 types of DC:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Friction</b>. Rubbing two surfaces together can knock off some of the valence electrons, causing current to flow.</li>
    <li><b>Heat</b>. Applying heat to something can give electrons enough energy to escape an atom.</li>
    <li><b>Pressure</b>. Some types of crystals, when subjected to pressure causes electrons to flow (piezoelectricity).</li>
    <li><b>Magnetism</b>. Moving a conductor through a magnetic field, or a magnetic field through a conductor will cause electons to move (generators, alternators).</li>
    <li><b>Photo Electricity</b>. Light striking the surface of some metals can dislodge electrons (ex: photo sensitive diodes).</li>
    <li><b>Chemical Action</b>. Chemical energy turned into electrical energy (flash light cell).</li>
    <li><b>Electrostatic Field</b>. An electrostatic field applied to the ends of a wire causes electrons to move.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id='cells'>Cells and Batteries</a></h3>

<p>A cell(electrochemical cell) is something in which chemical energy is converted to electrical energy. Batteries are effectively, groups of cells connected together.</p>

<p>Each cell in a battery has two conductors called <b>electrodes</b>, which are immersed in an electrolyte. The interaction between the electrodes and the electrolyte creates a chemical reaction resulting in a flow of current.</p>

<pre>

                B A T T E R Y

        Neg Electrode   Pos Electrode
                |             |
               ___           ___
           ----| |-----------| |----
           | .|   | . . . . |   |. |
           | .| - | . . . . | + |. |
           | .|   | . . . . |   |. |
           | .----- . . . . -----. |
           -------------------------

Dots are electrolyte, a mix of water and substances 
that separate into ions when dissolved.
</pre>

<p>Electrons flow from the negative electrode, to the positive electrode. The surface area of an electrode dictates the amount of current generated by the cell.</p>

<p>When connecting cells together to make a battery, they can either be connected in <b>series</b>, or in <b>parallel</b>.

<p><b>Series</b>. The positive terminal is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell, and thus the voltage increases. Ex: 2x6V batteries connected in series, equal one 12V battery.</p>

<p><b>Parallel</b>. The positives are connected to the positives, and the negatives to the negatives. The voltage of a paralleled battery stays the same as one of the component cells.</p>

<p>There are <b>primary cell and batteries</b> in which cannot be reused when all of the chemical energy is consumed (zinc carbon cell), and <b>secondary cell and batteries</b> which can be recharged (storage batteries, lead acid etc).</p>

<p>Important characteristics of a battery:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Shelf life</b>. How long it'll stay usable when not in use.</li>
    <li><b>Internal Resistance</b>. Limits how much current is available to use. When there is a load drawing a lot of current the voltage drops. As the cells age, or when the electrolyte dries out, internal resistance increases.</li>
    <li><b>Energy Capacity</b>. A value of current delivered over a specific period of time, usually amperes hours (Ah) or milliampere hours (mAh). Exceeding the stated current can decrease the shelf life of the cell/battery.</li>
    <li><b>Cell Voltage</b>. Dependent on the chemistry of the cell, electrodes and electrolyte.</li>
</ul>

<p>Main cell types:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Carbon-Zinc Cells.</b> Cheap, available, useful for infrequent use, requires little current. Produces 1.5V when fresh.</li>
    <li><b>Alkaline Cells.</b> A primary cell, long shelf life, allows for higher current, higher energy capacity. Produces 1.35V.</li>
    <li><b>Mercury Cells.</b> A primary cell, more expensive, long working life, maintains rated voltage until it dies. Produces 1.4V.</li>
    <li><b>Nickel Cadmium Cells.</b> Secondary cells, rechargable, hard to keep fully charged, very toxic mix (avoid).</li>
    <li><b>Lead-Acid Cells.</b> Secondary cells, most commonly used, supplies high current, inexpensive for capacity, require care, very corrosive electrolyte, releases hydrogen gas (must be aired out). Produces 2.2V.</li>
    <li><b>Nickel-Metal Hybride Cells(NiMH).</b> like Ni-Cads, but use hydrogen as active element instead of cadmium. Cell voltage is 1.2V </li>
    <li><b>Lithium Cells.</b> Secondary cells. Variety of chemical compositions result in a range of voltages(2.1-2.4V).</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id='schematic'>Circuit and Schematic Diagrams</a></h3>

<p>Terms:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Closed Circuit</b>. A complete circuit in which current can flow when a voltage is applied.</li>
    <li><b>Open circuit</b>. A circuit with a break in the line, stopping the flow of current. Deliberate breaks include switches.</li>
    <li><b>Short Circuit</b>. An abnormal connection betwween two points, resulting in some resistance, which can create a damaging flow of current.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schematic Rules:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Wires must be drawn as straight lines.</li>
    <li>Each component is represented by a symbol.</li>
    <li>The position of a symbol is not important (vertical, horizontal).</li>
    <li>Input ought to be at the top left, and output at the bottom right.</li>
    <li>Power supply wiring may not be drawn in, but can be referenced by labelled terminals or a chart.</li>
</ul>
