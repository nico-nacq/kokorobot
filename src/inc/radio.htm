<h3><a id='atoms'>Atoms</a></h3>

<p>Atoms have a central core called a <b>nucleus</b>, which is positively charged, and which contains one or more particles called <b>protons</b>. Outside of the nucleus is mostly empty space, but it also houses negatively charged particles called <b>electrons</b>.</p>

<p>A neutral atom has equal positive and negative charge (same quantity of protons and electrons). If an atom gains electrons, it becomes positively charged, and if it loses some, it becomes negatively charged, and is then referred to as an <b>ion</b>. When an atom loses or gains an electron/proton, this process is called <b>ionization</b>.</p>

<p>If an atom is under stress, say from heat, or by an electrical field, some of the outer shell electrons are dislodged. These are referred to as <b>valence electrons</b>, valence refers to the outer shell populated by electrons.</p>

<p>When current is run through something like a copper wire, electrons move from one atom to another. Electric current is basically just <b>a flow of electrons</b> through a conductor (material through the current travels, such as a copper wire).</p>

<h3><a id='current'>Current</a></h3>

<p>Current is measured in <b>Coulomb</b>(abbrev. as C). Note that this unit isn't based on one electron, but rather on a large group of electron because the charge of a single electron is too small to be practical.</p>

<p>We measure current by the rate that electrons flow through a conductor per second, this is measured in <b>Amperes</b>(abbrev as A). 1 A equals 1 coulomb per second.</p>

<p>The symbol for current is I, appearing on electrical diagrams, ex: I = 5A, to say that the current is 5 amperes. Current is measured with an <b>ammeter</b>, and can be expressed in milliamperes (mA, or 1 thousandth of an ampere) or in microamperes (uA, a millionth of an ampere).</p>

<p>Current that goes in through a conductor, must come out. There are two ways to look at current flow:</p>

<p><b>Electron current.</b> Where the current flows from negative to positive. Current flow is seen as excess electron entering a conductor, and pushing other electrons ahead of the line until one falls out.</p>
<p><b>Conventional current.</b> Where the current flows from positive to negative. Current flow is seen as an electron falling out at the end of a wire, leaving a gap, making it so that neighboring electrons all shift over to allow other electrons to enter at the other end. The gap left by the 'falling' electron makes it that the current flows in the other direction.</p>

<p>Both ways are used, these notes focus on electron current.</p>

<h3><a id='voltage'>Voltage</a></h3>

<p>Electrons on the outer shell(valence) are the ones easiest to move, held in their spot by <b>electrostatic forces</b>. Getting these valence electrons to move. When attempting to charge something, we're pushing electrons, which inevitably will be repelled by electrons already in the thing, and by each other. The act of putting a charge to something by adding electrons, that 'effort', is measured in volts (abbrev. as V).</p>

<p>The effort needed to charge an object is a unit of work(a measure of energy transferred by electrons per unit charge), referred to as <b>Potential Difference</b>(abbrev. as p.d) means modifying a system such that the potential energy at point A is higher than at point B. The magnitude of a potential difference is equal to the work done on a particle if it moves between the two points. The p.d. is measured with a <b>voltmeter</b>, and represented in diagrams as E. Ex: E = 12 volts. Small voltages are expressed in millivolts(mV, a thounsandth of a volt), or microvolts (uV, a millionth of a volt).</p>

<h3>Conductors</h3>

<p>Good conductors of electicity includes most metals, and some other materials. That a material is conductive, means that it is easier to dislodge its valence electrons.</p>

<p>Good conductors, from best to worse: silver, copper, aluminum, and gold.</p>
<p>Non conductors(insulators): glass, porcelain, rubber, and some plastics.</p>

<p>Copper is the most widely used metal for conductors. Aluminum is used in long distance transmissions. Gold, not being the best metal conductor, is mostly used for its resistance to corrosion. Cost, application, mass and strength determined what metal is best in a particular situation.</p>

<p>Some metals don't conduct as well as others, there is opposition to the flow of electrons, and this creates heat. This reaction is referred to as <b>resistance</b>. Ex: wires in element of a heater. When making radio circuits, this heat is not desirable, there are ways to eliminate the heat that is generated (resistors, see later).</p>

<h3>Tolerance</h3>

<p>The values of components in electronics are only approximations. These values only need to be near to the marked value to function in a circuit.</p>

<p>The maximum permissible variation from the stated value is called <b>tolerance</b>. They're written as percentages of the marked value, they can be added or substracted from that value. How much variation is okay depends on the application.</p>

<p>The larger the value of the variance, the lower the tolerance.<br>Ex: a resistor marked as 100 ohm with a tolerance of 10% may have a value of in the range of 100 - 10%, 100 + 10%, or 90 omhs through 110 ohms.</p>

<p>Common tolerances are +-20%, +-10%, +-5%, and +-1%.</p>

<h3>Resistance</h3>

<p>All conductors oppose the flow of electrons to a point, this opposition is referred to as <b>resistance</b>. The unit of resistance is the <b>omh</b>, measured with an <b>ohmmeter</b>. Larger resistances are measured in kilohms and megohms.</p>

<p><b>Ohm's Law</b> refers to how 1 ohm allows 1 ampere to flow when 1 volt is applied to a conductor.</p>

<p>How well a conductor conducts depends on:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Resistance</b>. Depends on material.</li>
    <li><b>Length</b>. The resistance increases as the length of the conductor increases.</li>
    <li><b>Diameter</b>. The resistance decreases as the diameter of a conductor increases.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature</b>. The higher the temp, resistance increases and conductivity decreases.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resistors</h3>

<p>When electrons are forced through a conductor (esp certain metals), the metal is heated, and this is due to the resistance of the wire (not as easy to dislodge valence electrons).</p>

<p>Resistors are rated for a limited amount of heat, if exceeded they can burn up. This limit is measured in <b>W (watts)</b>. The higher the wattage of a resistor, the more heat it can dissipate.</p>

<p>There are 3 kinds of resistors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed resistors</b>. Constant value of resistance.</li>
    <li><b>Tapped resistors</b>. Has taps/connections along the length of the resistance element to divide it into a variety of resistances.</li>
    <li><b>Variable resistors</b>. Has a moving slider/shaft that can change the resistance (like the volume control knob on old radios).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fixed resistor</b>. The most common type are composition, or wirewound.</p>
