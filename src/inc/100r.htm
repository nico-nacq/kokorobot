<p>I live and work on a 10-meter vessel called <a href="pino.html">pino</a> with my partner <a href='devine.html'>Devine</a>, we have sailed around the Pacific Ocean and realized how fragile the modern-day computing stack was. Living in remote uninhabited parts of the world has offered us a playground to learn how technology degrades beyond the shores of the western world.</p>
 <p>Since 2016, we have sailed from Canada, the US West coast, down to Mexico, over to French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga, New Zealand, Fiji, The Marshall Islands, all the way to Japan and then back again to Canada :>.</p>
