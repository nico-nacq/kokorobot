    <![CDATA[<p>Rekka awakens, having forgotten to write a year-end review for the past 6 years. They feel guilty about it, but aren't surprised—this is very typical. They start things and either lose interest, or forget about it entirely.</p><p>Damn shame. But it is what it is.</p><p>Much has changed in the last 6 years, I live on a boat, am genderqueer—well, this isn't new, I've never been entirely comfortable with myself, but this year I was able to reject my impostor syndrome, and started adopting the term—I write more, I sailed to Japan and around the Pacific Ocean, I get fewer anxiety attacks, I've become a bird nerd, learned a lot about living with less and on living closer to nature. Basically, I am now forever ruined, I cannot work for others again.</p><p>The year started in Montreal. In August of 2019, Devine & I left our boat Pino in Japan and flew home to Montreal for 6 months. January marked the 5th month of our sailing hiatus. It was our first time away from the boat, something that's caused me a lot of anxiety, manifesting as nightmares every night. I'd have visions of Pino filled with water, and cockroaches. Horrifying. I did say that I got fewer anxiety attacks this year, and then start by saying I had an anxiety attack. I swear, I got better.</p><a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/2020dec31.html'>Continue Reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Metrication in Canada began in 1970, but today, there is still use of non-metric units in everyday life. The reason for this, is due to the country's historical ties to the UK, and because of its proximity to the US.</p>

<p>Much of the english content on the internet is by American users who use the Imperial system. I find myself converting recipe volumes, and measurements almost everyday. I saved this table to help me convert with ease, without resorting to online calculators.</p><a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/conversion.html'>Continue Reading</a></p>]]>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/rug/3.jpg"></a> <p>One of the best ways to make use of old rope is to work up a set of rope mats. I made this mat using a 12 mm (1/2") old 35-meter (115 ft) main halyard, making a 6-pass Napoleon knot with a Flemish coil around it. The ropes were stitched together in the end so the mat would keep its shape.</p><p>I made a tutorial to show others how to make it.</p><a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/rug.html'>Continue Reading</a></p>]]>
